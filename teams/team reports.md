We are committed to bringing the community open reports on the work that we do. 

We are constantly trying to update this format to
suit the current needs of the project. For now, the reports will take the following shape:

- Each (full time) team member will commit a PR with (at least) one paragraph to the congress repo on each even Wednesday of the month by 15 pm GMT
- By 17 pm GMT on the same day they will be aggregated into a blog post to our [blog](https://cybercongress.ai/post/)
- By 18 pm GMT they will be published in our [TG channel](https://t.me/fuckgoogle) for Q&A from the community

Thank you and may the code be with you!
