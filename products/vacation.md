# Vacation policy 

Every team member can propose a vacation. The only rule is to warn other teammates about absence before a sprint is planned.

The algorithm for proposing a vacation is very simple, and should not take over 5 minutes:

1. Open a proposal for a vacation [here](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb/issues/new/choose)
2. Enter all the needed information according to the template
3. Assign congress members for a review. They will be able to advise you on your activities, whether they can be delegated or frozen for the duration of the vacation
4. Add your vacation to the calendar and encode it using the following colours:
- tomato: offline
- tangerine: available for emergency cases only
- banana: available part-time
- basil: out of office but accessible as usual
