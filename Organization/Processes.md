## 1. Principles

1. All in one place - GitHub - development, task managment, work documents storage.
2. GitHub tool - ZenHub app with browser extension - for enchancing GitHub task managment system.
2. Transparency - every team member or external observer can track working process and see work progress.
3. Flexibility - there are only several obligatory rules of working processes (like attending sprint openings, closings), others can be dynamicly adjusted by team, if there is a need for it.
4. Interactivity - every team member can bring new ideas or change work process in case it will increase productivity.
5. Communications - continious cammunications between team members, short daily meetings for task actualising, groomings.
6. Working cycle - sprint (dutarion ~ 12 days) with opening and closing procedures.
6. Task division - project division to medium size tasks (GitHub epics) and small taskt (GitHub issues). 
7. Planning - using GitHub project for placing epics in timeline.
8. Calendar - for event managment (currently Google Calendar).
