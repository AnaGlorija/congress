## 1. Principles

1. All in one place - GitHub - development, task managment, work documents storage.
2. GitHub tools - ZenHub app with browser extension - for enchancing GitHub task managment system.
2. Transparency - every team member or external observer can track working process and see work progress.
3. Flexibility - there are only several obligatory rules of working processes (like attending sprint openings, closings), others can be dynamicly adjusted by team, if there is a need for it.
4. Interactivity - every team member can bring new ideas or change work process in case it will increase productivity.
5. Communications - continious cammunications between team members, short daily meetings for task actualising, groomings.
6. Working cycle - sprint (dutarion ~ 12 days) with opening and closing procedures.
6. Task division - project division to medium size tasks (GitHub epics) and small taskt (GitHub issues). 
7. Planning - using GitHub project for placing epics in timeline.
8. Calendar - for event managment (currently Google Calendar).

### Zenhub board pipelines:

1. New issues. All issues for before planning.
2. Icebox. Issues taken after planning that won't be done for current and next sprints.
3. Next spring. Issues taken after planning that won't be done for current sprint but will be migrated to next.

## 4. Valuation & reporting

## 5. Productivity metrics

We use next types of metrics to track productivity:

- Personal metrics (for each team member)
- Product metrics (for each repo)
- Sprint metrics (for sach sprint)

### Personal metrics

- Story points (all, backlog,icebox,next sprint, in progress, review, closed)
- Productivity (closed points divide on all points)

### Product metrics

- Story points (all, backlog,icebox,next sprint, in progress, review, closed)
- Productivity (closed points divide on all points)

### Product metrics

- Sprint story points (all, closed)
- Productivity (closed points divide on all points)
