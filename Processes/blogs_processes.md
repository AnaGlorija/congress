# Blogs posting processes

It should be awesome if we'll post to community every week. 

We have 5 channels to broadcast to community information about our progress. 

Here is 

- [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybercongress/)
- [telegram](https://t.me/cybercongressofficial)
- [steem](https://steemit.com/@cybercongress)
- [twitter](https://twitter.com/cyber_devs)
- [medium](https://medium.com/cyber-congress)

The main idea is personal posts. Community manager will posting every 2 weeks sprint reports from one's own name. 
Each member of the team can make posts about congress or somthing else on personal blog. Community manager must make 
!()reposts of members posts.

Our main preffered channel for broadcasting is steem. On Twitter and Telegram will provide short desription about 
topic and link to post. Posts will dublicate on medium and reddit.
