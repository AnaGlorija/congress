# Work in progress

This is an attempt to discribe our cyber journey. This is a work in progress and any comments will be appreciated.

# Cyber~Metagalaxy 
Cyber is a galaxy of smaller components. We want to divide the work evenly and equally amongst several entities that are each responsible for their field of work. Most importantly, this work has to be done efficiently, and breaking it up into smaller parts - helps a lot. 

Cyber~ Metagalaxy now includes 3 products, they are Cyber as a protocol, Cyb, and Cyber~ Foundation. 

## Cyber~Procucts 

We define product as an independent, integral entity created to solve specific tasks. Each product can can evolve independently and at the same time each product is a kind of fractal structure. It means that regardless of product complexity at any dimension it reflect Cyber values.

## Cyber~Projects
Each product develops across multiple repositories. To organize the development process we aggregate issues in GitHub projects. Each project belongs to its own repository. Usually, the project outcome is release.

## Relises

Each product has his own relise. As we are driven by the same values sometimes we sync releases to achieve some goals. The nearst Big releas will be before the start of donation round.  

# Cyber 
Cyber is essentially creating a brand new protocol for adding and searching information onto a knowledge graph (a compilation of facts about something that provides meaning to the user). And rank this information. In other words, it's a decentralized google.

## Cyber repositories: 

[CyberD](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberd) A Consensus Supercomputer for computing relevance in web3, built with Cosmos-SDK & CUDA #fuckgoogle

[Cyberindex](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberindex) A Cyber data aggregator and exporter with support of knowledge graph

[Launch-Kit](https://github.com/cybercongress/launch-kit) Awesome launch tool-kit for Cosmos-SDK and tendermint based projects

[Js-IPFS](https://github.com/cybercongress/js-ipfs) IPFS implementation in JavaScript

[Crawler](https://github.com/cybercongress/crawler) A toolchain for bringing web2 to web3

# Cyb
Cyb is your friendly robot/personal browser application. One one hand it is a mere browser. But it isn't. The problem is that there is no such word as of now that describes what cyb is exactly. It is a browser in the sense that it lets you search for things. But it is your personal applications, that can understand many other things. It can act as a wallet. It can act as a database. It contains your cyber-space robots. For now, we call this a browser. But I would imagine that something along - a personal customizable web application, provides a better description.

## Cyb repositories

# Cyb~Foundation 

The role of cyber ~Foundation is to help the community govern the protocol via an Aragon DAO. It is a fund managed via a decentralized engine, charged with the donated ETH and managed by the community (agents of the protocol).
