# Pull request template

Thank you for your contribution. We hope that your work is useful. To avoid extra questions from our side please describe your PR and complete the checklist.

## Get in touch

Before starting to work on a feature or a fix please **open an issue** to discuss its use case, or a bug, with us. This can save a lot of time for both - you and us. For any non-trivial change, we ask you to create a short design document, which explains:

- Why is this change done? What's the use case?
- What will the API look like (for new features)? 
- What test cases should it have? What could go wrong?
- Roughly, how will it be implemented (we'll happily provide code pointers to save your time)?
