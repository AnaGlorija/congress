## Get in touch

Before starting to work on a feature or a fix, please **open an issue** to discuss the use case or bug with us. This can save both you and us a lot of time. For any non-trivial change, we'll ask you to create a short design document explaining:

- Why is this change done? What's the use case?
- What will the API look like? (For new features)
- What test cases should it have? What could go wrong?
- How will it roughly be implemented? (We'll happily provide code pointers to save you time)
