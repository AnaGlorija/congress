This guide explains how to:

## Opening issues

**Open an issue** to report bugs or to propose new features. Also, we suggest using our issue templates according to different problem types.

>Note: the problem will be solved as quickly as clear it is described.

## Development workflow

>ToDo. Customize it according to your project.

## Proposing a pull request


Pull requests are very welcome.

>Note that if you are going to propose drastic changes, be sure to open an issue to discuss this first. So you can make sure that your PR will be accepted before you spend effort coding it.

It would be awesome if you will open your pull request via the following steps:

- open an issue in which you are interested to commit to
- fork the repo and create your branch from `master`
- play with it and make significant changes
- if you've added code that should be tested, add tests
- if you've changed APIs, update the documentation
- ensure the test suite passes
- open a pull request and write a good commit message

For example:

```
#123 Refactor CONTRIBUTING.md

--Add Creating Commits And Writing Commit Messages Section
--Another Section
```
- submit PR;

Before we can merge the contribution we need to discuss changes. Normally, this takes several iterations, so don't get discouraged by change requests. They ensure the high quality that we all enjoy.
