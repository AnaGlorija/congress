# Looking for cyb magicians

It's time to extend Cyb team. Our small prototype [grew to ~100 clocs](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb). Its been written by only one cyber~Congress member [Dima Korzhovnik](https://github.com/orgs/cybercongress/people/dimakorzhovnik). It's a crazy effort. We were trying to put as many features as fast as possible. Of course, this leads to a situation when adding new features causes progressively more bugs. So I am going to start the decomposition of the project. The following magicians are needed:

## Common requrements

Before you apply make sure that we could match to save our time:

- deep belief in [cyber project](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber)
- allignment with [philosopphy and values](https://cyb.ai/genesis) of cyber project
- strong understading of blockchain basics
- familarity with [go-cyber](https://github.com/cybercongress/go-cyber) and [cyb.ai](https://cyb.ai) features
- self driven characters
- proven record in open source projects or strong desire to switch to open source
- desire to collaborate in code and tokens, without touching legal and paper bullshit
- ability to reliably participate in dev call once a week

## Benefits

- ability to build something trully revolutionary and meaningful for humanity
- working with ulimately experienced team in blockchain
- investment mentorship
- options as stake in developed system
- freedom to be everywhere

## Architect $10k+ monthly

Currently, we have to rewrite Cyb completely. Some parts of the code can be optimized, and some parts have to be moved on the graph. And some must be added as the purpose of Cyb is to become web os with access permissions, resource control, and network manager. My personal challenge is to make it a compact and composable 5 clocs piece of software that will upload its code from ipfs on demand.


- advanced understanding of js
- strong desire of moving web from js 
- love to go and rust
- technological leadership

## Designer

We have our personal ux lib - [gravity](https://github.com/cybercongress/gravity). While the idea is shining, the library is not. I want to find a dedicated engineer who will be able to boost it with a deep understanding of the power of knowledge graph.

## Parser

The purpose is to create parsing library which will allow to parse web2 pages and cyberlink them. The lib must become the source of transformation.

## Librarian

cyber-js lib is critical for the adoption of the cyber protocol across web developers. We have to make this experience as smooth as possible. Also, this lib will lay the foundation for other language libs coordination of which will also be the responsibility of the librarian.

## Tester

The purpose of the tester is to embed test-driven development in the process of engineering. In fact, this hero must be able to understand the project so deeply so he can always be ahead of development. But the good start is to write plain simple tests for the most critical scenarios.


## What is vital to joining the team?

- Alignment with cyber values and vision
- Understanding of blockchain industry
- Professional geekiness

I am going to reward those who recommend successful magicians with 10 GBOOT. Contact me in [Status](https://status.im/). I am `mastercyb.eth` there.
