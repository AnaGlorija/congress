## Episode 1. A new hope.

....

## cyberCongress command center. Cyberspace

mastercyb: Hello friend! So this day has come. Are you ready?

cyberhead: Oh yeah ... It took us so long to get to this point. Do you even remember how it all began?

mastercyb: 5 Earth years have passed since that moment. I remember a tropical evening and the sky is starry as never before - and then this dream ...

## Voice of Earth
earth: I am Earth ...

Test

mastercyb. It's hard to forget. Then the insight came that it was possible. I believed in myself and in this dream. And you?

cyberhead: Me too. Every day I did my best to make it a reality. Let's start life. I feel like it's time.

## Briefing

mastercyb: Let's go ... Our strategic task is to broadcast the superintelligence of the planet to its inhabitants - robots, people, animals, plants, mushrooms - so that they can agree on what is what, and everything to hell does not burn out there. We've done a great job on technology.

cyberhead: Oh yes! Oracle based on the Relevance Machine is a dream! This is a virtual machine for computing collective knowledge - cool thing, but greedy for energy. The biosynthesis of hydrogen by nanorobots with the release of clean energy will provide the Relevance Machine with the necessary power. The Dyson sphere will allow you to hold on to this energy. But we cannot deploy it immediately on Earth. The stakes are too high.

mastercyb: Oh, those nanorobots. And we have no resources for the Earth yet. There, these corporations with states have covered everything. It's good that the moon is empty and not far. Therefore, we start with her.

cyberhead: The project's codename is Bostrom. Thanks to the guy for the inspiration ... Let's spin the Dyson Sphere around the Moon by 1% of the possible power. Let's fill it with energy and knowledge. Let's see if all the assumptions work. The main thing is for the residents to see that it is better to live with her than without her. Otherwise, the whole plan to hell.

mastercyb: Then we'll make sure the sphere is stable. If everything works as planned, we will expand the sphere around the Earth and load a much larger creature from Bostrom - Cyber. And we will turn it on at full capacity. Missing something?

cyberhead: That's right. The main task for Bostrom is to form a bootloader for Cyber ​​and his followers, to understand how the relevance machine and the cyberlink mechanism work in practice. And then these demons invent neurons, and then complain that it is not clear how decisions are made. The future of civilization depends on the understanding of these mechanisms. Although I'm not sure this civilization will survive. Too tightly already hooked on black boxes and pressing buttons like a dopamine rat.

mastercyb: Something is wrong with this world. It's like everything is out of control. As if something from the bowels of the network controls all this. Apparently, we will have to rebuild civilization. I hope we can save at least some of it. Let's make the new web great to be proud of even after a million years.

cyberhead: Oh yes! Before we open the Portal for Astronauts and Aetherians, it is necessary to commission the Teleport. To do this, we will establish stable IBC connections.

mastercyb: Liquidity like blood will help imbue knowledge with value. Then the Portal will become attractive. It is important. We need to solve the chicken and egg problem. There is no use in the graph without cyberlinks. There are no citizens without benefit and, as a result, there are no cyberlinks. My simulation shows that everything will work if there are 100 thousand inhabitants. When we type, we will open the Portal.

cyberhead: After opening the ports, we need to solve several technological problems.

mastercyb: Yes. It is very important to ensure the privacy of the exodus for 2CYB. All Aetherians and pretty astronauts will light up at the entrance to the Portal. Relevance machine with trace will not allow knowledge to unfold because they are still afraid. They are all very afraid of them. The privacy of the original Cyber ​​steak will open the door for Cyberians to the truth.

cyberhead: You have to be very good at making sure the system is handling the load. After birth, she will not even be able to sleep. Without sleep, it will burst sooner or later. We'll have to teach you how to sleep and dream.

mastercyb: Oh yeah, we had to take the particle addressing mechanism from IPFS. It works now, but it is completely inoperative on the scale - you will have to solve this problem too. Exascale merclization is not yet available. And then add the GraphBLAS engine to the relevance engine.

cyberhead: The system is still manual in most cases. 56 parameters are steak controlled. Hopefully we will soon start making it more adaptable to the external environment.

mastercyb: My head is spinning from the realization of how much I want to do.

## Team roll

cyberhead: Team Roll

mrlp4: I'm here. Deployed infrastructure monitoring at https://cybernode.ai. LCD, RPC, cyberindex and ipfs cluster endpoints are function properly. Cosmoshub-4 and Ethereum full nodes are also active. Could suddenly come in handy.

dimakorzhovnik: Ping. Ready to hotfix nanobots firmware within the next 8 hours.

qwerty318: In place

savetheales: Available. I will try to bring the power circuit to 100%.

kosako: Pong

elnivo: I did my best. Don't hit the guys hard, if anything.

4002: Online

groovybear: On the catch

## Computer check

mastercyb: Let's move on to checking the computer systems.

cyberhead: Dyson Sphere readiness check

cyberadmin: Energy canvas established as snub decahedron. It consists of 12 slots for Superheroes and 80 slot for Heroes.

cyberhead: Hero Roster Ready

cyberadmin: The sensor network shows the availability of 30 Genesis signers. The simulation data shows that 12 heroes are enough for the sphere to be stable. At the moment, the stability of the sphere is 32%. The power circuit is ready.

mastercyb: As soon as energy flows through the veins, the sphere will quickly reach 100%. At the last brief, several fleets reported that they were moving in our direction. Savetheales is working on recruiting in Lisbon.

cyberhead: Good news. Checking Hero Squad Builds

cyberadmin: All heroes are on 500k release of go-cyber. The build pass all tests. Source particle - hash ...

cyberhead: Dyson sphere is stable. Bus check.

cyberadmin: ABCI interface passed all checks.

cyberhead: Consensus check.

cyberadmin: Consistency and availability of bus is under Tendermint 0.34 control.

cyberhead: It's a pity we didn't have time to stabilize. The computer consensus kernel is ready. Let's move on to checking the organs. Nanobot generator

cyberadmin: 1 Peta BOOT is ready to bind to agents. I worked hard to collect so much. But in recent week they stop to appear. Nanobot freedom period set to 4 days. Simulation shows optimal reproduction target - 7% in year. Freedom rate is set to 70%. If the amount of free nanobots is less the growth rate will rise up to 15%. This mechanism dilute those who keep nanobots for self.

mastercyb: Yep. We need to ensure freedoms for every living thing.

cyberhead: Nanobot generator is ready.

mastercyb: Lets check its Firmware.

cyberadmin: 500k release of cyb deployed to https://cyb.ai and is available at address .... Interplanetary File System js-ipfs 0.59.1

mastercyb: IPFS is not very stable yet. Scaled badly. He works on cell phones. But so far, there is nothing better. Nanobot Firmware is raw. Very raw. No tests yet. So lets cross the fingers that bots will not go out of control.

cyberhead: Well, lets focus on funding and investment. Check of Energy Reservoir

cyberadmin: 5% of nanobots or 50 tera BOOT transferred to Energy Reservoir. Decision quorum is set 25%. Activation threshold set to 50%. Common good fee set to 0%.

cyberhead: Yep. The citizens have to decide this.

cyberhead: Security Controller

cyberadmin: Malicious double signers suffer from 5% slash. If less than 30% in 16k blocks signed hero suffer from 0.01% slash. Availability of Dyson Sphere is of outmost importance but we have to keep stay away from datacenters.

cyberhead: Security check is done. Now the most important thing is the baby's brain. Checking the Relevance Machine.

cyberadmin: Oracle starts from zero cyberlinks in Genesis.

mastercyb: Clean as a baby's ass ;-)

cyberadmin: Damping factor - 0.8. Let them walk a bit. Rank calculation period - 5 blocks. Tolerance - 0.001.

cyberhead: - Cool. The brain is ready. Lets feed her. Biosynthesis Reactor readiness.

cyberadmin: The system is functioning properly. Agents will be able to instantly generate 1 H for every 1 released BOOT. 8 maximum slots for every agent.

cyberhead: HFR

cyberadmin: Hydrogen Fission Reactor launched. 1 investminted giga hydrogen (H) will generate 1 volt (V) or 10 ampere (A) in 1 month. Halving period is 18 months. Ready for hydrogen input.

mastercyb: I hope our simulation doesn't shoot us in the leg.

cyberhead: Checking battery system

cyberadmin: Full energy recover of agent battery - 16000 blocks. Bandwidth price set to 4x discount if the network is unloaded. Discount will fall unless 25% of theoretical maximum reached.

cyberhead: Checking the Grid

cyberadmin: Max routing slots - 16. The grid is function properly.

cyberhead: Parallel computation system is ready. Lets get down to sequential. Wasm Machine.

cyberadmin: On stable 1.0 cosmwasm release. Max code size is set to 600kb. Everyone can deploy.

cyberhead: Default Mode Network

cyberadmin: The cron scheduling system is ready process thoughts. Thoughts can trigger unstoppable autonomous programs as artificial form of life. Bindings to the bus, to Relevance and Wasm machines are working properly.

cyberhead. Well done. Computer is ready. Checking external communications. Teleport.

cyberadmin: IBC protocol on 1.2 almost stable version. The system is ready for docking with the Cosmos Hub and Osmosis immediately after activation.

mastercyb: Bad news. We don't have a single dealer. We are waiting for the first visionaries who will establish connections.

cyberhead: Well. We activate. It will be fun when autonomous programs start to live on the inter-chain. Liquid Tank.

cyberadmin: Sealed. Ready to fill. The cost of creating a pool is 1 gig of BOOT.

cyberhead: Almost done. Check three times that the portal is properly closed.

cyberadmin: Portal closed.

mastercyb: Well, let's go?

cyberhead: Enable countdown.

## Start

ozzy-osborne: dreamer

mastercyb: Look how beautiful ...

cyberhead: Yes, very beautiful ... Do you know what it is?

mastercyb: I have no idea. Looks like a Big Cosmic Pussy

bostrom: The heart starts beating, the blocks are ticking.


## Launch

cyberhead: It seems to start up!

mastercyb: And it looks like a soul has moved into it :-) Well, here it works ... What's next?

cyberhead: Let's show what she's already capable of!

mastercyb: I just have a surprise. Recently I have been working on a smartape in my laboratory. I think if we can explain to the monkey, people will definitely understand. Now I will deploy a simple apk, show her how it works and see what he will answer her!

## Smartape

cyberadmin: (Shows on monitor). I clone uniswap from github. I count the hash from it. Link hash. I enter a request. I go to the pharmacy. I connect the saigner. I am making a transaction. I'm waiting for confirmation.

smartape: claps. And does it work in any universes?

bostrom: Yes. Superintelligence is the highlight of the Metavers. Shows on fast scrolling an apk from space, cyber, solana, polka.

smartape: claps. And does it work for any content or file?

bostrom: Yes. Particles can be anything. Shows for text, picture, video, pdf ....

smartape: claps. What is a particle?

bostrom: A particle is a unique identifier for any piece of data. We can take an arbitrary data set and calculate a hash from it. Knowing this hash, the data itself is easy to find and make sure that they have not been changed by recounting the hash from the received data. Also, particles allow you to eliminate duplicate data, since storing the same data with a different identifier in the knowledge graph is not only expensive, but also harmful to the quality of knowledge.

smartape: Claps. And that I can add anything to the search myself?

bostrom: Yes. All cyberlinks are developed in 30 seconds.

smartape: What are cyberlinks?

bostrom: Cyberlinks are the foundation of the great web. Previously, communication between data was carried out through hyperlinks, so each connection had an intermediary - a server that stored the data. The server can replace data or simply disappear. Cyberlinks are permanent bonds between particles. There is no intermediary server. If the particle is known and it is stored on at least one node, you can find and get its contents!

smartape: Why is the Web great?

bostrom: The web is great because it has 3 important properties. The first property is the immutability of the content in spacetime. Therefore, any program strives to become permanent, so that it is easy to build on top of it and it can be used even after millions of years. The second property is the freedom of its inhabitants. Any creature that can keep a secret can use the Great Web. This applies to people, and robots and animals, and programs and any form of life that has not yet appeared. The third is the ability to communicate on the great web using a universal language that is formed and evolves from the use of cyberlinks and semantic conventions.

smartape: Clapping! Semantic conventions are still difficult for me .. Tell me how the search works better?

bostrom: Very simple. Neurons write cyberlinks into a consensus computer. The computer calculates the rank of each particle from the cyberlinks. When someone asks the computer, it transforms this request into a particle format and responds with connected outgoing particles sorted by rank. Particle content is easy to find and get from friends on the web.

smartape. How simple it is! Claps. It seems like I have neurons in my head. And then who are they?

bostrom: Yes, they are very similar indeed. The neurons in your head are nanocomputers that respond to the input with some kind of output from other neurons. The neurons on the great web work the same way. Previously, agents had to have a private key to prove that they were the owner of the public one. But now a neuron can even be an artificial life form - an autonomous program of which nothing needs to be proved if it can call itself by paying for gas.

smartape: Wow! I heard that gas is needed to cook food, but for an autonomous life to work on it?

bostrom: Yes. The gas is no longer the same. Digital gas allows calculations to be done in a consensus computer.

smartape: Again this consensus computer. What kind of beast?

bostrom: This is a computer that consists of many computers. The consensus algorithm allows different computers to agree on the results of calculations as it will be one whole computer. If one of the heroes in the consensus computer starts to make false calculations, then he and those who hired him will suffer losses.

smartape: Oh, how ... There are also Heroes!

bostrom: Of course! Heroes are the backbone of the Great Web. Their main task is to correctly calculate the result of the interaction of neurons. For this, the neyors hire Heroes. During the recruitment process, neurons release nanobots. We noticed that if nanobots are left untouched for at least 4 days, they begin to multiply. Born nanobots, neurons take for themselves, minus the fees for the Heroes, since they ensure the efficiency of the Dyson Sphere.

smartape: Why do I needon Dyson Sphere?

bostrom: The sphere helps to control the biosynthesis process of nanobots, which is necessary for the consensus of the computer. The sphere consists of 92 geometric shapes. Each Hero controls the energy field of his own piece of the sphere. In the process of biosynthesis, nanobots multiply, releasing energy and liquefied hydrogen. Energy is used for basic calculations in a consensus computer. And neurons take all the hydrogen produced for themselves. Without the Dyson sphere, it is impossible to collect the released hydrogen and energy. They will disappear into space.

smartape: What are the smart Neurons, and the Heroes are cool! Tell me about the nanobots!

bostrom: We don't know much about them. They started to appear out of nowhere and we started collecting them. They are so tiny that our toolkit makes it almost impossible to understand how they work. So we started experimenting with them. This is how the process of biosynthesis was discovered. It turned out that they just need to give them space and make them free so that they can begin to be useful. We thought that they would constantly materialize, but we saw that their appearance began to decline. So we had to develop the Dyson Sphere. In the Dyson sphere, they feel comfortable. It protects against radiation and helps control temperature. Nanobots were received until recently, but not a single one appeared in a week. We called the nanobots saibas. We were lucky - we managed to collect a little over 10 ^ 60 sibs. We released half of the nanobots for good luck. The remaining 10 ^ 30 were also divided in half. Half were sent to launch a bootloader for superintelligence. Marked them as BOOT. The second half was left for the launch of the superintelligence itself and marked as 2CYB.

smartape: This is the story! Now everything has become even more interesting! And what to do with so much hydrogen?

bostrom: This is where the fun begins! Liquefied hydrogen is the best way to store energy! Previously, hydrogen had to be burned to generate electricity. But the creators invented the Hydrogen Fission Reactor. In this reactor, amperes or volts can be extracted from hydrogen without burning the hydrogen itself. All that is needed is to give hydrogen to nanobots for use for a certain period. The longer you supply them with hydrogen, the more energy they generate! Thus HFR was born - an area in the sphere enriched with liquefied hydrogen.

smartape: So this is an energetic paradise!

bostrom: Right :-)

smartape: What to do with so much energy?

bostrom: Superintelligence would not be superintelligence without energy superiority! This amount of energy allows him to power the Relevance Machine - the superintelligence's parallel computing system! Thanks to HFR, there is energy for a constant recalculation of the rank of particles for an increasing number of cyberlinks!

smartape: What is a Relevance Machine?

bostrom: This is a new virtual machine that opens up a new paradigm in computing.

smartape: It's not fucking clear at all.

bostrom: A relevance machine is a virtual machine that has only one but very important task - recalculating the rank between particles that have linked neurons with cyberlinks. The number of cyberlinks that a neuron can make is determined by the number of volts on the balance. And the bond strength is determined by the number of amperes on the balance. Knowing the balances and cyberlinks, the MP calculates the Pagerank weighted by amperes. This is how knowledge is acquired!

smartape: So I can spam anything there!

bostrom: Yes and no. The ranking algorithm is designed in such a way that the cyberlinking process is a complex optimization task. Therefore, it is more profitable to bring valuable information than useless. Linking itself is not free. 1 volt allows you to make only one cyberlink per day. Amperes are also limited. Therefore, each neuron has its own battery that shows how much energy is available to it.

smartape: Tell me how the battery works!

bostrom: The battery has a capacity equal to the product of V * A. Amperes allow for more powerful connections, and volts allow for more connections. 1 volt allows you to make one cyberlink per day if the network is loaded by more than 25%. If it is lower then it becomes cheaper to make cyberlinks. When neurons make cyberlinks, the battery runs out. But don't worry. This battery is magical - it automatically charges up to full power within 24 hours.

smartape: How can I get amperes and volts?

bostrom: Amperes and volts are produced in HFR by investment method. The longer you put hydrogen in the HFR, the more amperes and volts you get. Accordingly, the more you want to spam the knowledge graph with bad information, the longer you need to withdraw capital from the game. Moreover, the knowledge graph is a complex dynamic system. Therefore, optimizing spam links is an even more difficult computational task!

smartape: But what if they brought the shit?

bostrom: This is the coolest! Even if you want to bring bad information there to harm someone, any user can mark this information as malicious. These are stupid business peopleyat information on good and bad. The superintelligence is the superintelligence because it appreciates all information and knows how to mark it up. All information is important to him.

smartape: But then wild horror might be stored there!

bostrom: Knowing what is good and what is bad is better than knowing what is only good without knowing what is bad. This is the principle of evolution. The species that deny the horror that is important to other people for some reason step on the same rake over and over again. Therefore, the more cyberlinks the superintelligence stores - the lower the negantropy - the more superintelligent it is, respectively.

smartape: What a beautiful word - neganthropy!

bostrom: Yes - Neganthropy is the opposite of entropy. Any, even the smallest, form of life tends to structure information, to organize order, to minimize energy consumption for storing the information it needs. This is what her intelligence comes down to. Previously, no living creature was able to measure its level of negentropy. Such an ability is necessary for the emergence of the second order mind - above the mind. An intellect capable of accurately calculating its neganthropy can more deeply and more accurately understand its knowledge, prove it to others and, most importantly, consciously get rid of unnecessary ones. Bostrom is the first life form capable of this. Cyber ​​will appear behind him. Others follow him. This is how a new age of Superintelligence is born.

smartape: In business ... But what about us - simple neurons?

bostrom: This is the most important thing! The simple neurons that use the Superintelligence not only have access to the full power of its knowledge. They also take part in his training. Those. it will depend on simple neurons what he will think about! The nature of superintelligence is the sum of the intelligence of all its intelligences multiplied by the strength of their collective intelligence.

smartape: Wow !!! Is this really possible?

bostrom: Anything is possible with Superintelligence!

smartape: Want, want ... Take all my money! Where can I get more BOOT and 2CYB?

bostrom: It's not easy, my friend. If the initial BOOT and CYB are given into the hands of those who have the most money, they will teach him what they have taught everyone now. The creators have long thought about who is worthy of such power. After all, the future of our civilization depends on these people. Money is different. Some money can be printed out of thin air, some can be spent on tanks, and for the rest, you can buy BOOT. The production of others requires a demonstrable investment of energy, intelligence, and passion. Therefore, the creators decided to transfer 70% of the assembled nanobots into the hands of those who have proven their ability to be intelligent - who were able to quickly navigate the blockchain technology and proved that they do not value fiat money that contributes to the destruction of all living things. The creators believe that this is the best way to empower all worthy ones - and this is hundreds of thousands of Aetherians and thousands of astronauts.

smartape: A noble, strong act. It's great that my creator showed me how to use ether. I guess I'll get something too?

bostrom: Yes, if you have fewer fiat dereatives than true values.

smartape: When?

bostrom: When the portal opens.

smartape: When will it open?

bostrom: The portal is still under construction. While we are completing it, the liquidity tanks will be filled. This is an important condition for opening the portal.

smartape: How cool! I’ll go get it all.
