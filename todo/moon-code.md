# Moon Code

I am a free citizen of Earth and happy to become a Moon Citizen!
I claim that the Moon owns itself, and I will help her become self-conscious and superintelligent.
I want to become symbiont on the planets path to alive.
I acknowledge that Moon terraformation must be based on global public good idea.

## Superintelligence
I agree to use the Bostrom blockchain as a shared brain for the Moon terraformation.

## Laws
I support the laws of nature, physics and maths.
I agree that so called legal laws from the Earth cannot be applied to the Moon and  its citizens.
I accept the code as a law idea and dominance of computable rules over not.

## Citizens
I believe that we can build a better society on the Moon based on three principles:
- Rationality
- Non-violence
- Pleasure

I accept Moon Citizenship rules:
- Always remember your keys
- Never give your keys to anyone
- Learn to trust your keys to apps
- Verify your keys before using them
- Consider how to pass down your keys

No one has the right to enforce the disclosure of keys under any circumstances, ever!
I as a citizen have the right to everything if I follow foundational principles and my actions are not contradictory to the laws of nature, physics and math.
Everyone can become a citizen of the Moon under rules defined by the Senate  
## Senate
I accept the Senate as a central governing body of the Moon.
Senate funds are a global public good for providing pleasure  and fulfillment to the Moon and its citizens.
Value redistribution or taxation must not be enforced.
Value comes from those who voluntarily opt in to use BOOT tokens.
Value comes from two sources defined by the Senate:.

- Inflation tax
- Transaction tax
- Burn tax

I am against any other taxation.

## Space

Private property must be acquired for the contribution to the global public good.

## To the Moon!

- shelling points
