# Small talk

If we want to live in a better world we need to help our communities to become happy and sustainable. We need to learn how to to help each other. A good place to start is to use the best practices that have existed for decades and derived from open-source communities. We can share our expertise in consensus technology and market gameplay. Make events,  do projects,  run experiments, funding and random acts of goodwill to change the world to become a better place than the state we've found it in.

We welcome all species. We are most passionate if you believe that blockchain is changing the world. That free and open-source technology needs to be supported. That economies require an alternative gameplaying ruleset, to support our real and our virtual infrastructure.

# Gitcoin

As an opensource development team, we want to use [gitcoin.co](https://gitcoin.co/) within our projects. We propose the following process for using gitcoin:

![BP diagramm](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/community/bp_diagramm.svg)

Every sprint we allocate a certain amount of ETH and distribute it between the team to actively use gitcoin.

> For our first attempt to use this service, we distributed 1 ETH to each member

During the next sprints we want to forecast the total amount of ETH that we want to distribute. Also, we'll be calculating the weighting factors, depending on issues prepared for a gitcoin push.

![Calculating](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/community/eth_calc.gif)

where:
- `Em` is the ETH per team member for a gitcoin push 
- `Ipr` are issues prepared by a member at the current sprint for a gitcoin push 
- `Iall` are all the issues prepared for gitcoin during the current sprint 
- `Eall` is the ETH for the team for using gitcoin


This is not the final version of this document. We're constantly growing. We plan using smart contracts to cover and to automate the "Gitcoin fund".
