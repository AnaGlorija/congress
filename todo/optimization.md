# Optimization to reach target

In order to make gift more attractive we came to a price optimization:
- ETH/H must grow from 0.02 GWEI up to 1 GWEI
- bostrom must become main supplier of liquidity and price information of itself
- teleport liquidity of our tokens must be higher than on osmosis tenfold
- A and V raise to some target in H
- TOCYB must grow in H from ... to ...
- H must grow in BOOT until equilibrium reached
- H must become unit of account
- TOCYB must become store of value
- internal and external tvl of teleport must grow in H
- tvl in ETH must grow from ... to ...
- current ibc users in ETH must grow from ... to ...
- organic internal volumes must grow from ... to ...
- organic ibc volumes must grow from 1 ETH ... to ... 1000 ETH
- organic ibc users must grow from ~100 to 2000 

## Parametrs optimizations
- raise gas prices ...
- switch gas payments to H
- burn 50% of gas fees
- raise band (A, V) prices
- staking target move down to 20%

## Maximaze investment into liquidity

- [move liquidity](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues/475) from Osmosis to Bostrom
- invest cyberCongress cosmos assets into bostrom liquidity
- invest personal cosmos assets into bostrom liquidity
- invest Senate funds into bostrom liquidity 3 month liquidity program
- reinvestment of swap fee and arbitrage into liquidity, price and volumes
    - osmosis<=>bostrom arbitrage bot
- launch 3 month liquidity program

## Incrase visbility

- [messari](https://messari.io/asset/bostrom) listing
- mintscan listing
- listing of teleport on cg and cmc
    - emulate internal teleport volumes for listing teleport on cg and cmc
- listing of native tokens on cg and cmc
- emulate ibc volumes for better appearance in mapofzone
