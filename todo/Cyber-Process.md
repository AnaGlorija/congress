# Work in progress

This is an attempt to describe our cyber journey. This is a work in progress and any comments will be appreciated.

## Cyber~Metagalaxy 
Cyber is a galaxy made of smaller components. We want to divide the work evenly and equally amongst several entities that are each responsible for their field of work. Most importantly, this work has to be done efficiently and breaking it up into smaller parts, helps a lot. 

The cyber~ Metagalaxy includes 3 products, they are the Cyber protocol, Cyb, and Cyber~ Foundation. 

## Cyber~Products 

By products, we define an independent, integral entity created to solve specific tasks. Each product can evolve independently and at the same time, each product is a kind of fractal structure. It means that regardless of the complexity of the product at any dimension, it reflects Cyber values.

## Cyber~Projects
Products develop across multiple repositories. To organize the development process we aggregate issues inside GitHub projects. Each project belongs to its repository. Usually, the project outcome is a release.

## Releases

Each product has its release. As we are driven by the same values, sometimes, we sync releases to achieve our goals. The nearest big release will be before the start of the donation round.  

## Cyber 
Cyber is essentially creating a brand new protocol for adding and searching information onto a knowledge graph (a compilation of facts about something that provides meaning to the user). And ranks this information. In other words, it's a decentralized google.

### Cybers repositories: 

- [CyberD](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberd) A Consensus Supercomputer for computing relevance in web3, built with Cosmos-SDK & CUDA #fuckgoogle
- [Cyberindex](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberindex) A Cyber data aggregator and exporter with support of knowledge graph
- [Launch-Kit](https://github.com/cybercongress/launch-kit) Awesome launch tool-kit for Cosmos-SDK and Tendermint-based projects
- [Js-IPFS](https://github.com/cybercongress/js-ipfs) IPFS implementation in JavaScript
- [Crawler](https://github.com/cybercongress/crawler) A toolchain for bringing web2 to web3

## Cyb
Cyb is your friendly robot/personal browser application. On one hand, it is a mere browser. But it isn't. The problem is that there is no such word as of now that describes what cyb is exactly. It is a browser in the sense that it lets you search for things. But it is your personal applications, that can understand many other things. It can act as a wallet. It can act as a database. It contains your cyber-space robots. For now, we call this a browser. But I would imagine that something along - a personal customizable web application, provides a better description.

### Cybs repositories:
 
- [Cyb](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb) Personal Immortal robot for The Great Web
- [dot~ Cyber](https://github.com/cybercongress/dot-cyber) A reference interface for the cyber protocol
- [Cyb~ Snap](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb-snap) Cyb snap for Metamask
- [Gravity](https://github.com/cybercongress/gravity) Energy-efficient interface library
- [Chaingear](https://github.com/cybercongress/chaingear) The consensus computer-driven database framework
- [Cyb~Channel](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb-channel)

## Cyb~Foundation 

The role of cyber~Foundation is to help the community govern the protocol via an Aragon DAO. It is a fund managed via a decentralized engine, charged with the donated ETH and managed by the community (agents of the protocol).

### Cyb~Foundation repositories:

- [Cyber ~Foundation](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber-foundation)
- [Aragon-Vesting-App](https://github.com/cybercongress/aragon-vesting-app)
- [Aragon-Auction-App](https://github.com/cybercongress/aragon-auction-app)
- [Great-Web](https://github.com/cybercongress/great-web) The Great Web monthly journal
- [Cybaca](https://github.com/cybercongress/cybaca) Small app for huge community growth
