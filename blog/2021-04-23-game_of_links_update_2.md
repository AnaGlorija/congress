title: 'Proposal #33. Updates to the Game of Links'

On March 6th, the Game of Links final was prolonged until the 1st of May [by proposal #28](https://cyber.page/governance/28). The rationale behind the proposal evolved around the development of the next stage of `Cyber`, the `Bostrom` canary network. That proposal mentioned that if the allocated time won't be enough, the Congress team will propose a new timeframe, and here it is:

1. Prolong the final of the Game of Links until the `~3 weeks` deadline before the launch of  `Bostrom`. This means that we're going to close the disciplines of the game, only with the knowledge of the launch date.
2. Change the distribution of disciplines(load, relevance, lifetime, delegation) to 500 GCYB.

*Rationale:* As expected, the Congress team requires more time for the launch of the `Bostrom` canary network. We need a running network to keep developing cyber.page and onboard new community members.

We would like to include new players, that have joined Cyber over the last few months of the game. Furthermore, our goal is to make the Game exciting and honest for all players, in light of any changes. Organic distribution is the success key for the growth of a blockchain project, and we don't want to miss out on future masters and heroes.
