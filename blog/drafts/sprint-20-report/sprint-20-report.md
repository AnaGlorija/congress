### Ð¡onclusion

Yet another sprint where we tried to fess up to.

With our attempts to create cyberd PoC based on Cosmos SDK we [hit at performance bug of Tendermint and Cosmos](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberd/issues/50). Moreover it's huge problems with multithreading. For now we want to add current implementation to Cyb for tests. As a next step we looking for Solana as base for cyberd PoC.

Next release of Cyb [was held](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb/releases/tag/0.0.2). We added navigation for queries to cyb and cyberd. Also we added menu with apps for "Settings" button and made search bar redesign. Also fixed few bugs from previous version.

At the current sprint we are preparing for DevCon. We want to show our Cyb with [navigation](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb/issues/41), new version of [Whitepaper](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberd/issues/25), [built-in keystore](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb/issues/39) and [web3 positioning](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb/issues/55). Also we preparing to show built-in [Chaingear](https://github.com/cybercongress/chaingear) in Cyb with updated UI.
