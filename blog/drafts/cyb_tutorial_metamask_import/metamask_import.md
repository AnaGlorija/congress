Hi everyone! Today we'll take one giant step to regular Cyb using.

At this time import of account is available just through the private key. All private keys storing at local storage.

>Disclaimer: Cyb in Ethereum Mainnet may not be secure yet. We recommend operating accounts with small balance at your own risk.

After successful installation of the latest version Cyb and launching you should see the screen like this:

Type in a search field `wallet.cyb` or click on the wallet button.
Cyb will offer you create the password. Create and confirm it. And PLEASE store that. This is your key to Cyb.

Click `Create`.

Cyb had created the ETH account already, but we want to import own account from metamask.

So, go to your browser with a metamask extension, in my case, this is FireFox and click on a metamask icon.

Click on a `...`  and then `Expand View`

Click on `DETAILS` BUTTON.

After that click on `EXPORT PRIVATE KEY` button, before metamask presented your private key it asks you for a metamask password. Type it.

Now you can see:

Copy your private key to clipboard and go back to pure web3 browser ;) I mean Cyb.

Click on `IMPORT ACCOUNT` tab and paste your private key into the requested field.
