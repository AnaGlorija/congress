This article for Dragonereum players who was faced with trouble around Chrome, Mozilla, Opera + Metamask using. We want to explain how to play Dragonereum with a pure web3 browser.

First of all download and install [the latest release](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb/releases) of Cyb and don't forget about star ;)

2. Launch Cyb. You must see something like on the screen:

3. Click on the wallet and create a password for Cyb.
Remember this password to avoid balance missing.

4. For playing in Dragonereum you need ETH account. Cyb created it already. You can use it or import yours. If you decide to play with the provided account PLEASE copy your private key and store it somewhere!

I want to import my account from Metamask. So I click import account, insert private key and after few second see my account:

Don't worry about balance value! We'll fix it. Click on `MAKE MAIN` button to make this account active.

5. Click on the `gear` button at the right top part of the screen. You must see this:

... and click `MAIN` and after that click `update` opposite `ETH NODE`. Now you connect to Infura mainnet node.

6. Go back to your wallet. Now balances are valid.

7. It's Dragons time! Now put following hash `QmSqGUcEk6D1Mm1EB5RM4H423LaE3yBtB2GYbw5tUoBgwu.ipfs` in the search field and press `Enter`.

here is a Magic!

Good luck Dragon Master!

P.S. Cyb in Ethereum Mainnet may not be secure yet. We recommend operating accounts with small balance at your own risk.

P.P.S. For comfortable using click the `heart` to pin game to side menu.

P.P.S. For advanced users only! You can change [IPFS](https://steemit.com/web3/@savetheales/how-to-add-custom-ipfs-node-to-your-cyb) and [ETH](https://steemit.com/web3/@savetheales/how-to-add-own-eth-node-to-your-cyb) nodes to your local nodes just by changing addresses. Don't forget about the `UPDATE` button.
