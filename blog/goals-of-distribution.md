While designing the initial distribution structure for the Cyber protocol we aimed to achieve the following goals:

\begin{itemize}
\item Develop provable and transparent distribution in accordance with best industry practices
\item Allow equal participation irrespective of political, regulatory or any other restrictions which may be imposed by outside agents
\item Prevent attacks on privacy such as installment of KYC requirements
\item Spread distribution in time to grant equal access to initial distribution, without any limitations such as hard caps or any other restrictions for most of the agents
\item Honour genesis Cosmos investors for the development of technology which made possible simplified development of Cyber protocol
\item Attract the most professional validators from the Cosmos ecosystem for bootstrapping the network
\item Allow easy early access for active agents of the Ethereum ecosystem in order to accelerate the growth of the knowledge graph and solve chicken and egg problems
\item Decentralize management of auction donations starting from day 0
\item Honour 30 months of cyberâ€¢Congress R\&D and community behind it
\item Avoid using proof-of-work schemes due to environment considerations
\item Make distribution games enjoyable and fun for participants
\end{itemize}
