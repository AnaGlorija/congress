**DRAFT**

To propose 3 publishing routines dependent on the task

What needs to be done:
- Identify 3 types of importance and describe what events should be included in each one
- For each type, add channels
- For each channel, add the flow of publishing

A) Major news: working releases/launches, major media coverage, cyber events, public speeches  about cyber with a recording

Twitter, Today in Cosmos, Reddit (cybercongress / cosmos network), own blog, TG group announcement, ? 

B) Important news: articles that are of lesser importance, other events with our participation, pre-announcements, non-major technological updates, governance-related
