Hi everyone! Today we'll take one giant step toward regular Cyb usage.

At this time import of account is available only with your private key. All private keys are encrypted and stored at local storage.

>Disclaimer: Cyb in Ethereum Mainnet may not be secure yet. We recommend to operate accounts with small balances at your own risk.

After successful installation and launch of the [latest version Cyb](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb/releases) you should see a screen like this:

Type in the search field `wallet.cyb` or click on the wallet button.
Cyb will ask you to create a password. Create and confirm it. PLEASE store it. This is your key to Cyb.

Click `Create`.

Cyb had created the ETH account already, but we want to import our own account from metamask.

So, go to your browser with a metamask extension, (in my case this is FireFox) and click on the metamask icon.

Click on a `...`  and then `Expand View`

Click on the `DETAILS` button.

After that click on the `EXPORT PRIVATE KEY` button. Before metamask presents your private key it asks you for a metamask password. Type your key.

Now you can see:

Copy your private key to your clipboard and go back to your pure web3 browser ;) I mean Cyb.

Click on the `IMPORT ACCOUNT` tab and paste your private key into the requested field.

Your account should now be visible in your wallet.

To activate an account address and use it for transactions click on the `MAKE MAIN` button

Done! Now your operations will go through this account!
