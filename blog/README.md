# Blogs posting processes

It would be awesome if we'll post to our community every week.

We have 1 preferred channel for broadcasting - steemit, and 3 other channels to broadcast to the community the information about our progress.

Here the are:

- [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybercongress/)
- [telegram](https://t.me/cybercongress)
- [steem](https://steemit.com/@cybercongress)
- [twitter](https://twitter.com/cyber_devs)

The main idea is personal posts. Community managers will be posting sprint reports, once a fortnight from ones own name.

Each member of the team can make posts about congress or about anything else in his personal blog. Community managers must make reposts of members posts.

Our main preferred channel for broadcasting is steemit. On Twitter and Telegram we will provide short description about
topics and links to posts. Posts will duplicate on medium and reddit.
