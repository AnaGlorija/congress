# Blogs posting processes

It should be awesome if we'll post to community every week.

We have 1 preferred channel for broadcasting - steemit and 3 other channels to broadcast to community information about our progress.

Here is

- [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybercongress/)
- [telegram](https://t.me/cybercongress)
- [steem](https://steemit.com/@cybercongress)
- [twitter](https://twitter.com/cyber_devs)
- [medium](https://medium.com/cyber-congress)

The main idea is personal posts. Community manager will posting every 2 weeks sprint reports from one's own name.
Each member of the team can make posts about congress or something else on personal blog. Community manager must make reposts of members posts.

Our main preferred channel for broadcasting is steemit. On Twitter and Telegram will provide short description about
topic and link to post. Posts will duplicate on medium and reddit.
