Today is special day. After one year of development Dragonereum will be born. For me this is a very important milestone and in this post I will explain why.

The last time I dedicated [a whole post](https://blog.cyber.fund/ethereum-yet-another-next-big-thing-7168157480bc) to a blockchain system was 3.5 years ago. That was also a very special day: [We launched Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/block/0). That post was not very popular. Nobody those days gave a shit about the most important developments. There are a lot of exciting thoughts there. There are quite precise speculations which are still relevant, but one thing must especially catch your attention: DApps Economy. This list was crafted by me during research before the Ethereum genesis. Only two apps from this list are now (somehow) operational: Augur and Digix. With deep respect to both projects we can hardly say that they are successful in some sense. Now I am going to discuss my criteria for successful execution of dapps, and I will discuss some examples and demonstrate that we are still nowhere.

## Still no killer dapp

Here I am claiming that three and a half years since inception we still fail to deliver one example of a rrrrreally awesome dapp.

A have about 30 ethereum tokens in my portfolio. In order to make this decisions about 3000 projects were accessed by me (economic protocol and implementation) over the last 5 years. During this way I defined 5 very simple criteria for successful execution:

1. Openness and verifiability since inception
2. Purposeful, value-add distribution
3. Rich internal economy with feedback loops
4. Fully working app with retention signals so loved by VCs
5. Harness full power of blockchain technology

I will dedicate a standalone post to discuss this criteria later. Because less than 2 hours are left before the dragons arrive I will throw you a few examples. The following projects are loved by me because of early signals of (4) and I do have them in my portfolio. Yet:
- DAI: A really useful thing, but MKR failed to meet (2)
- REP: Checked funded amount in ETH, compared against current cap in ETH you will see that this project does not satisfy (2). Also (4) is not here yet as I regularly use this app.
- MLN: No (2) and (4)
- MANA: No (2) because founders are too greedy (2/3) and still no awesome VR world (4)
- SPANK: No (2) because founders are too greedy (2/3) and (3) because cybernomics are too weak

I can continue, but you get the idea.

## Why did I decide to help found Dragonereum?

Investing in the Ethereum ecosystem I:

1. am tired of greed
2. tired of the stupid desire to bring something to the masses that was not intended for them, e.g. Ethereum.
3. saw how rush harms products
4. saw how the willingness to solve legal problems first which do not exist yet (in reality or an unwillingness to meet a risk or a desire to suck the govs because of fear). This is a good way to kill key, revolutionary  product features
5. believe that blockchain gaming is the best use case for technology

When I met the guys from Dragonereum during the hackathon in Minsk they had fire in their eyes and a real ability to do something great. I decided that this is a good chance for me to prove to myself that my decision to invest in Ethereum during genesis was not complete bullshit.

## Meet Dragonereum

1. Openness and verifiability since inception
2. Purposeful, value add distribution
3. Rich internal economy with feedback loops
4. Fully working app with retention signals so loved by VCs
5. Harnesses the full power of blockchain technology

During game development I do believe we solve some really hard problems such as onchain EVM randomness. Also, we have created a brand new branch of science: digital genetics. It is better for you to reason yourself by reading our [whitepaper](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmfR75tK12q2LpkU5dzYqykUUpYswSiewpCbDuwYhRb6M5).

Now I will elaborate further on economics since that is my area of expertise.

## About GOLD cybernomics

> Cybernomics is a non-existent branch of cybernetics. It explores the behaviour of systems in which every signal of any agent to any agent can be proven to everybody. An art of cybernomics is to design abstract systems using free market principles and game theory which can provably sustain and evolve.

Dragonereum's cybernomics stems from the willingness of gamers to evolve better DRAGONs in order to earn more GOLD.

The more DRAGONSs are fighting the more expensive GOLD is to earn from the Treasury. Treasury is guaranteed to be replenished using the players GOLD for incubation through embedded genetics: stronger DRAGONs are likely to earn more GOLD. This basic feedback loop stimulates GOLD internal liquidity.

Cybernomics programs population control as well. DRAGONs are very cheap to generate at Genesis stimulating aggressive growth in order to become the dominant species in the Ethereum universe. Then DRAGONs are incentivised for rapid population growth as available player supply of GOLD inflates faster than deflation, as a result of environmental cost of incubation. So, like in real world, evergrowing population is limited by available resources. Once the environmental resources become more scarce deflation starts to dominate over inflation thus guaranteeing store of value for gamers who earn more GOLD.

There is an embedded economic measure to ensure that the dragon population growth will be limited by target game design constraints. Our simulation shows that if players will use basic game mechanics using only 100k dragons it is highly unlikely that the Ethereum foundation network will be able to compute enough even counting for gas limit growth according to the Moors law in the following years. Hence after the 10000th dragon will be born half of the incubation costs will be permanently burned in order to cover the costs of environmental harm for all players. Given that the cost of incubation is a constant 1000 GOLD, and 500 GOLD will be burned every incubation, the relative price of every coming incubation will be higher thus limiting theoretical supply at the level of 109999 DRAGONs and 500 GOLD. Nonetheless this theoretical bound likely cannot be reached.
