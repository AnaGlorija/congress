### Сonclusion

What a productive sprint! Seriously. We combined sprints 21 and 22 because in a second one was too codeless. We also made useful acquaintances, but more about that later.

First, we updated our [web3 vision](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb/blob/master/docs/web3-vision.md) by @xhipster. It's an early draft for the web3 summit but we chosen to begin developing now. This vision includes our DURA spec that must displace URLs.

Second, we clearly see two ways of web3 development: web3 around the web3 foundation and web3 around the ethereum foundation. We don't know exactly what to do with this but it's a fact :)

We also have nice cyb [release](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb/releases/tag/v0.0.22) and cyb whitepaper [draft](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb/blob/master/docs/cyb.md). Now it's available on desktop and includes 3 nodes (ipfs, ethereum and cyberd). You can test search by ipfs in wiki, connect local ipfs node, link hashes and try to install apps. It looks great.

Another amazing thing happened during blockchain week in Prague! Cyber•Academy made its first meetup in Europe! @xhipster delivered a presentation and sent his regards to Zuckerberg.
You can see how it went [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjwdvdbosNg). The most interesting part begins around [11:39](https://youtu.be/sjwdvdbosNg?t=699) :)))


Enjoy! Because the Powers That Be already saw our cyb ^^

P.S. Yeah! We were at devcon iv with the whole team in Prague! It was awesome! Thanks a lot to the [Neptune](https://www.laurainserra.com/) room and for orgs! It was a new level of conference!

P.P.S. Part of our team was at the web3 summit in Berlin and you know what? It was an underground web3 movement. Why? Berlin Funkhous, devs presentations and a really strong motivation to change the modern web.
