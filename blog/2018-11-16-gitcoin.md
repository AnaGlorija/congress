Hi everyone! In our [agreement](cyb://QmaXfCR86ZL6gRXK8knMoVCzQSFMzwsYcJnT7DE68g5QY2.ipfs) the phrase "open-source" appears six times! Not bad for 2 pages,  isn't it? We believe in this mighty power and have no vision of evolution without it.

Today I want to provide insights into our communication with the open-source community and the collaboration process.

A little more than half a year ago we learned about [gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/). For more details you can explore their platform. We are really excited about it. This is a solution around the incentive problem in open source and it really works!

After a few tests we have developed a [gitcoin process](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/tree/master/community) where we try to define the rules of the game where our team is motivated to be involved and gitcoin contributors have incentives to jump on board.

This is not a final solution. It must stand the test of time and iterations but we are sure that it should work!

What does it mean for our community? We want to pay you for your contribution! We constantly fund our issues on gitcoin and attach descriptions of them with the current project state and user stories. Please referencethe article below. We try to reply to comments regularly in issues and in our [devChat](https://t.me/fuckgoogle).

For now we are selective about issues that we fund. We are looking for organic evolution which is why our growth happens little by little. It's doesn't mean that we ban funds for all feature requests by the community and concentrate on our issues only. Definitely not! We give priority to issues we have for now, but if you have the ability to fund a feature request personally - do it! I believe this will boost our organic growth. :)

Another important point is that we are looking to hire through gitcoin. Yes, we need passionate and young souls for our projects. But we refuse to use standard corporative hiring processes. For us it is really long, boring and power-hungry. With gitcoin we kill two birds with one stone. This is another killer feature of gitcoin and that is why we love it :)))

Every two weeks I'll write about gitcoin and our current state in our blogs. There will be short articles with well funded issues around all communities, short analytics, new features, and so on.

As I promised...
List of opened issues for 2018/11/16:
- [Decreasing Gas Consumption, Audit](https://gitcoin.co/issue/cybercongress/chaingear/993/757)

[Our page on gitcoin with full list of issues](https://gitcoin.co/profile/cybercongress)

Let's build our open-source community and let's do it with incentives :)
