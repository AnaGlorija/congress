We had a great reboot on our trip to Iceland in August 2018 and now we are ready to face new challenges. For this block we decided to focus on the development of [cyb](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb), [cyberd](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberd) and [chaingear](https://github.com/cybercongress/chaingear) projects. As a result of this sprint we have the first web3 browser [release](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb/releases/tag/0.0.1) and the [first PoC](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#001-2018-09-25) of cyberd. We look forward to your feedback, feature requests, and bug issues. :)
