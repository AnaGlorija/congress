title: 'Proposal #28. Updates to the Game of Links'

On December 30th the Game of Links final was prolonged until the 1st of March [with proposal #19](https://cyber.page/governance/19). The rationale behind the proposal evolved around the development of the next stage of `Cyber`, the `Bostrom` canary network. In the proposal, we have mentioned that if this won't be enough, the Congress team will propose a new timeframe, and here it is:

1. Prolong the final of the Game of Links until the 1st of May 2021, instead of 1st of March 2021
2. Close the `load` discipline on block `3638501`
3. On the 1st of May 2021, close all disciplines, excluding `lifetime`
4. Keep the `lifetime` discipline incentive until the launch of `Bostrom`
5. Close the `lifetime` discipline when `Bostrom` is ready for launch

*Rationale:* As expected, the Congress team requires more time for the launch of the `Bostrom` canary network. We need a running network to keep developing cyber.page and onboard new community members. We discovered a non-trivial bug in the `load` discipline, which was the apotheosis of the discipline. Hence, the continuations of the discipline carries no logic for the development of the network, graph, etc.

We would like to include new players that have joined Cyber over the last few months of the game. Organic distribution is the success key for the growth of a blockchain project, and we don't want to miss out on future masters and heroes.
