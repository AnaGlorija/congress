Hi everyone! Today I will show you how to open a web3 link with our web3 browser. If you have read our last [post](https://steemit.com/web3/@savetheales/gitcoin-lovers) you should have noticed the IPFS hash at back matter. The thing is that we have a web3 blog :)

First [download](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb/releases) the latest version of Сyb and install it.

Next click on the Сyb icon. You will see something like this

This is the Root Registry, by the way, which we will talk about later. It is not so important which page is opened, we just need to find the search field at the top of the page. So, let's copy ipfs hash from the previous [post](https://steemit.com/web3/@savetheales/gitcoin-lovers), paste it in the search field and attach `.ipfs` to the and of hash.

If everything is correct the following raw markdown file will be displayed. :)
As you see this is the current [post](https://steemit.com/web3/@savetheales/gitcoin-lovers) which is broadcasting in ipfs and has been signed by me ;)

You can also try the following hashes as homework:

Now you can explore the Internet and find hashes of content you are interested in :)

In the next post we will connect the local ipfs node to our Сyb ;)
