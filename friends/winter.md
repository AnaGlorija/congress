# A warm winter letter to our friends 

On the 3rd of January, the cyberCongress team has launched its first public testnet `euler` of the `cyber://` protocol. There will be 6 more of those coming soon, as per the [planned roadmap, which was announced at cyberc0n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfG_mn6psRQ&t=11587s). The `euler` network, shows our approach, to how the search might actually work in practice.

But, there is still a lot of work to be done before our dream can come true. As soon as the cyberCongress team will accomplish its plans, and the world will see the idea becoming alive, every human on the planet (and not just this one), will get an alternative to Google and Chrome: a web3 browser 'Cyb', with a fully working search engine, on the base of the 'Cyber' protocol.

We believe that this opportunity is a very important step in the development of web3 generation technology. Without raising the bar so high, the dreams of quick and seamless adaptation for computing consensus for up to 100 million people, will not come true.

Further, in this letter, I will go on to explain why we need a round of donations from friends. And, will offer you to take part in it. I will also provide you with some links, to dive deeper into the project.

## About cyberSearch

The main target of the project is to create the best possible alternative to Google on web3. There are 3 main repositories that are part of the project:

- [cyberd](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberd) - a high-performance computing consensus to perform search and get answers, based on cosmos-sdk
- [cyb](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb) - a web3 browses with built-in search function on the base of electron
- [chaingear](https://github.com/cybercongress/chaingear) - CRUD-TF database on the base of solidity

Together, those three repositories form a simple, but a powerful entry point to enter web3 and for further development.

From the `euler` 0.1 release, the project went live by launching `chaingear`: a database on Ethereums main net. And now, it is literally seeking to go into space, by launching the useful implementation of the search protocol  `cyberd` on the base of `cosmos-sdk`. The broadcast to Ethereum and to Cosmos networks, happens via - the already working, browser `cyb`. The system is not stable as of yet, but it is already, a working and a useful concept.

For the past two years, from the moment of its conception, the only donors of the project were, exclusively, the guys from the cyberCongress team, donating a total of: 110.2 BTC + 380 ETH. For those donations, the team was allocated 4.1529% of the CBD distribution.

Today, after it became obvious, that the project will come to existance, the cyberCongress team is calling to its friends in order to make the next step in the adoption of our beloved crypto world.

## The winter round of donations

We have decided to structure the winter round, that has 2 equal, in its meaning, goals:
- the starting of the formation of the trusted set of validators
- donations to the project via cyberCongress, prior to the Genesis 

```
Contributors, that will donate ETH or DAI
to the cyberCongress multi-signature address 0xb52b7eda722249499e3a28b5bb6c778ee0ac462c
in between the 10.11.2018 and the 06.02.2019 (included) GMT, will be allocated:
- 2.1153% CBD in the case that the size of the donations will not reach 2000 ETH
- 3.1153% CBD in the case that the size of the donations will be higher than 2000 ETH
- 4.1153% CBD in the case that the size of the donations will be higher than 5000 ETH
to be evaluated in ETH at the time of the transaction. 
```

As the donation round ends, you will receive CBD tokens, to the address from which you have made your contribution. Those tokens will perform the function of a store of value until the main tokens of the CYB network are released (right up to its Genesis). You will receive CYB tokens, as per the conditions of the allocation described above, to the cyber account that is corresponding to your public key in the Ethereum network, on which your CBD tokens are held, at each new testnet.

As per this moment, based on the conditions of the winter donations round, there is already 671 ETH donated from the team. That means that the round will happen in any case.

Some calculations: If, at the end of this round, there will be 1000 ETH of donations collected, it will mean that the valuation of the project will be (roughly) ~50k ETH or ~7.5M DAI. If, at the end of this round, there will be more than 2000 ETH contributed, than the valuation of the project will be ~65K ETH or ~10M DAI.

We consider this round of donations to be private. We are not publishing any details about the contributions in any public sources. Nowhere, apart from the source code of the project itself. We are sending this message to you, because, we trust you, in both - ethical and in professional terms. As per our views and beliefs, we do not hold any KYC process for the incoming means. But, we do hope, that you will be forwarding this letter to those that you trust enough. This is because we do not wish to go back to the experience of public funding.  

Another thing that is of great importance for us now, is to get the backing of developers that are interested in the validation of the network, during its early stages. This means, that this round of donations is probably more orientated towards that kind of people.

It should be noted, that this round of donations is not structured as a contract, but is implemented via direct contributions and donations. This means, that if you send your contribution via an exchange, you will not pass the evolution test, and your tokens will be a gift to the exchange.

I would like to underline, that all the donations are used for the development of the open-source code of a useful token, that (1) already exists, and (2) is a utility, as you will need it, in order to perform search and to influence the search ranking.

Because the CYB token is at a testing stage, its value is limited with the help of the CBD token, which is our community token on the Ethereum network.
