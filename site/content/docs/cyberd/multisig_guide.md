# 2 of 3 multisig account creation and sending transaction guide

`Cyberd` uses docker container technology for usability. If you don't use docker container and use `gaiacli` or you've installed `cyberd` from binaries this guide is useful for you too. Just skip some docker features, because this guide focused on docker users. Remind: this guide covers all types of transactions, not only send. Also, this guide actual for Cosmos Hub Gaiacli users excepted bandwidth in Cosmos we pay a fee with tokens.

Do not forget about `--chain-id` flag in `cyberd` and even `Cosmos Hub` networks. Current `<chain-id>` you can always get in master branch of product repo.

## Creating multisig

Multisig account creating and sending transaction is simple and clear but a little bit long.

1. Go inside docker container:

  1.1 Detect `<container_id>`
      ```bash
      docker ps
      ```
  1.2 ... and go inside it
    ```bash
    docker exec -ti <container_id> bash
    ```

2. Import or create thresholders accounts for multisig:
```bash
cyberdcli keys add test1
cyberdcli keys add test2
```
3. Add pubkeys of remote thresholders accounts:
```bash
cyberdcli keys add test3 --pubkey=<thresholder_pub_key>
```
Now we have 3 accounts for multisig account generating: `test1` and `test2` on the local machine and we have access to them. `test3` from remote thresholder and we haven't access to it. All created and imported accounts you can check with:
```bash
cyberdcli keys list
```

4. Now we can create test 2-of-3 multisig account named, for example, `multitest1` with keys `test1`,`test2` on local machine and `test3` by remote thresholder:
```bash
cyberdcli keys add multitest1 --multisig=test1,test2,test3 --multisig-threshold 2
```

5. You should top up your balance of your multisig account. Make sure if you have enough bandwidth to make transaction later.

## Spending from multisig

6. Create unsigned transaction from multisig account and store it in `unsigned.json` file:
```bash
cyberdcli tx send <recipient_address> <amount>cyb --from=<multisig_address> --chain-id=<chain_id> --generate-only > unsigned.json
```

7. Sign this transaction with the following command and store signed file in `sign1.json`:
```bash
cyberdcli tx sign unsigned.json --multisig=<multisig_address> --from=<your_account_name> --output-document sign1.json --chain-id=<chain_id>
```

8. Now you need to send the resulting file to remote thresholders for signing. You can see the content of the transaction file with
 ```bash
cat unsigned.json
```
command and copy content to convenient for you `.json` file and send it. Also, you can copy this file from docker container to local machine by following command
```bash
docker cp <container_id>:/unsigned.json .
```
File will been copied to current repo.

9. Remote thresholder should to sign it too like it was two steps below and send you signed file back. For example `sign2.json`


10. Copy signed file from remote thresholder in a docker container by the following command:

```bash
docker cp sign2.json <container_id>:/sign2.json
```

Your docker container should content 3 `.json` files: `unsigned.json`, `sign1.json`, and `sign2.json` at least. This is necessary and sufficient condition because we've set up 2 of 3 multisig account

11. Go bask inside a docker container and generate multisig transaction with all signs.

```bash
cyberdcli tx multisign unsigned.json multitest1 sign1.json sign2.json --chain-id=<chain_id> > signed.json
```

12. Finally we need to broadcast this transaction to network

```bash
cyberdcli tx broadcast signed.json --chain-id=<chain_id>
```

If multisig account has enough bandwidth transaction should be broadcasted.
