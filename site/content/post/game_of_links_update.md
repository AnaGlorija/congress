title: 'Proposal #28. Updates to the Game of Links'

December 30 we've prolonged the Game of Links final till 1st March [by the proposal #19](https://cyber.page/governance/19) rationale with hard development of the next stage of `cyber` - `Bostrom` canary network. In case if this won't be enough time, we will propose one more prolongation, and here is it:

1. Prolong final of the Game of Links till 1st April 2021 instead of 1st March 2021
2. Close the `load` discipline on block `3638501`
3. Close all disciplines exclude `lifetime` for validators at 1st April 2021
4. Keep the network alive by `lifetime` discipline incentivization till `bostrom` launch
5. Close the `lifetime` discipline with ready for the `bostrom` launch

*Rationale:* As expected we need more time for the `bostrom` canary network launch. Also, we need a running network to keep cyber.page development alive and community onboarding. The `load` discipline showed us a not trivial bug, and this is an apotheosis of named discipline. Continued use of this discipline to the detriment of network, knowledge graph, and the final distribution.

We still want to include all the new players that have joined Cyber over the last few months in the game. Organic distribution is the success key for the growth of a blockchain project and we don't want to miss all of our future masters and heroes.

## Proposal

```bash
The current proposal is about the Game of Links updates.
Results of this proposal will change the Game of Links rules.

1. Prolong final of the Game of Links till 1st April 2021 instead of 1st March 2021
2. Close the "load" discipline on block 3638501
3. Close all disciplines exclude "lifetime" for validators at 1st April 2021
4. Keep the network alive by "lifetime" discipline incentivization till "bostrom" launch
5. Close the "lifetime" discipline with ready for the "bostrom" launch

By voting "yes" I agree with the above updates to the rules of the Game of Links.
