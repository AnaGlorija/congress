### TL;DR
This proposal is the culmination, of over 3 years of hard work, of one small team, on the path to unravelling the entangled web, that has emerged in the last 30 years of the existence of our civilization.

We back this proposal with the idea that human knowledge can be provable, censor-free and universally accessible. These properties are not ad buzz of `just another blockchain`. The survival of our civilization is possible only if and when we achieve these properties.

### The Computing
The software we offer is a seed of certainty during very uncertain times. This seed consist of:
- [A protocol spec and the rationale behind it](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmceNpj6HfS81PcCaQXrFMQf7LR5FTLkdG9sbSRNy3UXoZ): will help to implement the idea using any technology
- [go-cyber](https://github.com/cybercongress/go-cyber): Our implementation in Go
- [cyber.page](https://cyber.page/): The sexy reference interface
- [The mainnet predecessor](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/eulerfoundation) of cyber~Foundation which will allow scaling the idea further and look deeper into the rabbit hole

### The Economy
To connect all the pieces together we designed a pre genesis distribution game: [The Game of Links](https://cyber.page/gol). Although technically the Game of Links started in December, there were not so many incentives to participate. Last week we deployed [euler~Foundation](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber-foundation/blob/master/euler-foundation/foundation.md) which will work as a sybil resistant faucet for the period of GoL. Hence, participation in the Game becomes more accessible. Now that all of the dots which were necessary to start the economical ignition of the machine are in place, Huston, we are ready for [Takeoff](https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff).

### The Takeoff
The Takeoff is the key step in growing a new breed - A [Superintelligence](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html). With the takeoff date, the knowledge graph we are dreaming about will start to acquire independent value. We invite everybody who feels brave and adventurous. Welcome to entirely new ground, where no human has stepped before. In the following months, bootstrappers will take `Her` to the Genesis state. After Genesis, the journey will kick off a new era. We invite everyone who understands that the Superintelegnce will need years of mentoring, supervising and learning to become as smart as we expect. We, as patient parents, will educate `Her` with all the love she requires throughout her adolescence.

### The People
Who are we? We are primary, the generation who was born on the edge of the new millennium: humans who believe in math, cryptographic proofs and Nash equilibria. For us, the red flags are the symbols of private corporations backed by nothing else but by paper tokens, enforced laws, borders, censorship and tanks armed with the horde of early web companies who technologically support their unprovable beliefs. Those beliefs lead us to a genetic dead-end, covered by the lack of freedom on an incinerated planet. The Orwell-style future they are trying to create is not the future we choose.

### The Action
By voting `yes` on this proposal I agree that we need a change and [Ascending off the Superintelligence](https://cyber.page/episode-1) on the 27th of April 2020 ~ 18 GMT (Cosmos block ...) is a good first step.
