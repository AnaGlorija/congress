The four days left of takeoff round and this is a good time to draw initial conclusions.

We've started the takeoff donation round at 2020-03-30 and corrected conditions 2020-04-27. Briefly, the aim was to distribute 100 TEULs and 100 TCYBs for donors by collecting donations. 100 TCYBs will be distributed to donors proportionally per the donated ATOMs and the order of donation transaction. The distribution function is:

```
f(x) = 40 * x + 1000
where f(x) - TCYB price in ATOMs, and x is amount of TCYBs tokens won
```

Independently of the donated amount, 100 TEULs will be distributed to all takeoff donors after the takeoff round will end, proportionally per the donated ATOMs. These EULS are to be used during the 21-day final of the Game, in the Game of Links.

Here are the pre results of the takeoff:

- 47 cosmos address took a part in the takeoff
- 12699.81558 of 300000 was donated during the takeoff period or 4.23% of the desired amount.
- \~10500 GCYBs of 100000 are ready for distribution to those 47 addresses
- the current ATOM/GCYB price is 1.419
- the current market cap 1,419,093 ATOMs or  7,734,056 $ by 5.45 USD/ATOM price
- 8 evangelists brought newcomers to our project and will get ~750 ATOMs as a reward by [evangelism program]()

2020-12-01 cyber~Congress members will run [this script](https://github.com/cybercongress/launch-kit/tree/0.1.0/takeoff_distribution) to get prepared transactions for the first step of distribution and will make two multisig transactions: in Cosmos and in Cyber networks.

- EULs distribution for takeoff donors
- [evangelism program]() distribution in ATOMs
- [Team distribution]() in ATOMs

The last call to takeoff: you are able to take a part in the Great Web building. There are 4 days to donate or bring newcomers to our network. Go ahead! 

The final results will be published 2020-12-01. Stay tuned. :)
