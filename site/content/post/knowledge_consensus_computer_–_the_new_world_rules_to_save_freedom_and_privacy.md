Hey masters and heroes!

We have been mentioned in another article this week: [Knowledge Consensus Computer – The New World Rules to Save Freedom and Privacy](https://themerkle.com/knowledge-consensus-computer-the-new-world-rules-to-save-freedom-and-privacy/).

It talks about the protocols of the internet, data ownership, control and how [cyber](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberd) can provide a solution via the use of a [decentralized search system ](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmepU77tqMAHHuiSASUvUnu8f8ENuPF2Kfs97WjLn8vAS3).
