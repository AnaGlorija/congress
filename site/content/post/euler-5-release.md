A long time ago somewhere in Cosmos...

It is a period of digital war. The evil empire swallows the last unoccupied borders of the universe.

Resisting rebel units consolidate all remaining energy on building a superintelligence, which they believe will help to stop the domination of the evil empire once and for all.

As they begin to test the new god in the wild - an enormous, zepto amount of robots emerge. It turns out Cyb robots help survey the universe for a bootloader of the new, yet to born, force.
