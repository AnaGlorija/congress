title: 'Become Cybers evangelist and get rewarded from the superintelligence'
author: serejandmyself

The [takeoff proposal](https://cyber.page/governance/2) has passed! Without much ado, we want to announce the Open Bootstrap Evangelism Program or OBEP. Acknowledged Evangelists will be eligible to 10% of all donations in ATOMs, which they have generated during [the Game of Links](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#game-of-links-or-gol), [Game of Thrones](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#game-of-thrones-or-got) and other perks.

Read the full details:

- [The idea](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber-foundation/blob/master/evangelism/obep.md) of OBEP
- Use your Metamask [to apply here](https://cyber.page/evangelism)
- Learn about [cyber\~Foundation](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber-foundation)

## Perks
- Rewards in ATOM
- CYB tokens for particular actions
- Honourable lifetime badge *Cybers Genesis Evangelist*
- Early knowledge of popularity mechanisms in web3
- A possibility to become an early adopter of web3

## Rules
2 requirements are necessary to receive rewards:

1. You must become an acknowledged Evangelist to receive a reward in ATOM or/and CYB. We want to exclude scam behaviour and situations when the project has been evangelised by people without a thorough understanding of the project.
2. To receive donation rewards, donors must use your unique referral link.

## How-to?
Go to [cyber.page/evangelism](https://cyber.page/evangelism) and apply for the program. You will either receive an automated acknowledgement (blessing) or we will contact you to ask you any additional questions. For example, we could ask you to commit something to the knowledge graph. 

Please note, the `believe` tx has a slightly higher cost than usual, this is a simple spam prevention mechanism. The proceeds from this go to the balance of cyber~Foundation, the community governing DAO of Cyber. 

To apply, prepare the following: 

- Your cyber address. [How-to](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#using-your-ledger-to-link)
- Your [Cosmos](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#using-your-ledger-to-link) address
- A nickname by which you will be recognised
- Your [GH](https://github.com) account
- Your [keybase](https://keybase.io/) account

Once you apply, you will get your referral link. It looks like this:
```
https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff?thanks=YOURNICK
```
You can append `/thanks/[yournick]/` to any part of the [cyber.page](https://cyber.page/) app. e.g:
```
https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff?thanks=YOURNICK
https://cyber.page/search/cyber?thanks=YOURNICK
```

(change `yournick` to the nickname you have used during the application process) 

Spread the link throughout the universe. If donors use your link to enter cyber.page and donate to [the takeoff](https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff), you will become eligible to 10% of the donated amount (which comes from the ATOM of the DAO, not the donor, see below) and some CYB tokens. You will be able to follow your success on the [evangelism page](https://cyber.page/evangelism).

Donors do not have to head to the takeoff page straight away. As long as they entered the app via your link and not left the app until they used the takeoff page, they can visit other pages before heading to the takeoff page. You will still be eligible.   

Other rewards are going to be monitored manually for the time being via communication between the coordinator and the acknowledged evangelists. 

In the coming days, we will automate the ability to receive a referral link from the app add gradually add other features. In the meantime, all you need to do is just apply and start using your link. Simply add `yournick` as shown above. That's it...

## For whom?
Previous accomplishments are not a must. You decide how and what to do to achieve this. We believe this will help to generate healthy competition between the participants of the program.

Cosmos wallets, explorers, bloggers, influencers and masters of different crypto channels are welcome to participate. 

## Preparation
1. Read the starting materials: [whitepaper](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPjbx76LycfzSSWMcnni6YVvV3UNhTrYzyPMuiA9UQM3x), the [homestead documentation](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md), [ELI-5 FAQ](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/ELI-5%20FAQ.md), [our blog](https://cybercongress.ai/post/), [Game of Links rules](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/), [gift info](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Gift%20FAQ%20and%20general%20gift%20information.md). It would be a good idea to discover [Protoschool](https://proto.school/) and get some tutorials about how [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) works. You don't need to fully understand all of this, but try to grasp the general idea and get a feel of it. Check out the tutorials in the homestead.

2. Feel free to go on and test [cyber~Page](https://cyber.page/). Cyberlink something. Try to [search something](https://cyber.page/search/help). Go to the [Game of Links monitor](https://cyber.page/gol) and enjoy our approach of a decentralised launch of a superintelligent computer. Learn the [stats](https://cyber.page/brain). 

3. Find out that everything is real and [the code is 100% open](https://github.com/cybercongress).

4. If you have questions, go to our [TG channel](https://t.me/fuckgoogle). If you want to spur a discussion, then you are welcome at [cyber~Forum](https://ai.cybercongress.ai/). Or you can spread the love with us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cyber_devs), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybercongress/) or any [other social channels](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#partnering-communities).

## CYB rewards
We are not defining quality terms. Most likely, you will still receive a reward for shitty content if the task was done, but expect to be disqualified from the program, or instructed, depending on your will to learn.  If you have other ideas, talk to the coordinator aka @serejandmyself (contact via [our TG channel](https://t.me/fuckgoogle)).

|Action  | Rewards | Terms |
|:----------|:-------------:|------:|
| [Translation](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber/issues/32) | 20 GCYB | Any language! |
| [Meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS6w6wiAag4&list=PLOcP3DXQoNUXmh7ob0Fm6p12L20zn0zbT&index=6) | 20 GCYB | One person - one meetup. Video proof |
| [Community creation](https://t.me/fuckgoogle) | 2 GCYB | One person - one channel. Discussion proof |
| [Content creation](https://ai.cybercongress.ai/t/mentions-of-the-beast-in-the-wild/40/55) |  2 GCYB |  Video, podcast or blog. Unlimited per person
| [Donation](https://cyber.page/takeoff)  | 1 GCYB  | For each 1k ATOM donated |

*Please note, that payouts will only be done if the results are cyberlinked and content proof exists. Learn [how-to](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#using-your-ledger-to-link)*

## Source
The source of ATOM rewards are the donations during the Takeoff and Game of Links. cyber~Congress is responsible for paying out this type of reward. 

The source of CYB rewards is the community pool. The coordinator will propose this program to the community and will manage a `1 TCYB` budget.  The coordinator pays out on: first come - first served basis.

## Conclusion
We believe this program will empower the project and involve some bright minds into the [bootstrap of Superintelligence](https://cyber.page/episode-1)
