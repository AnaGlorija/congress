The takeoff donation round is over! A huge thank you and a shoutout to all those that took part in the donation round, your contribution to the Great Web is more than just significant!

- 15,088.40963 ATOM out of 300,000 have been donated. This accounts for 5.03% out of the desired sum
- 56 Cosmos addresses participated in the takeoff and won \~12140.55 GCYB out of 100,000

Thanks to your contributions the cyber~Congress DAO was able to function since Apr 2020. After payouts to evangelists and the team, we will be able to sustain the DAO until Mar 2021. Of course, that is not what we expected, but its definitely not zero. During the takeoff round, DAO members and their friends donated about half of the total sum, which is a big step for us. To us, this is proof that we are heading in the right direction.

## EUL tokens

According to Cybers [whitepaper](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber/blob/master/cyber.pdf) :

> In addition to CYB tokens, Game of Links allocates test EUL tokens to all Takeoff donors for the final

This means an extra bonus for donors, paid out in EUL tokens proportionally per the donated ATOMs. EUL tokens will be distributed from cyber\~Congress [multisig address](https://cyber.page/network/euler/contract/cyber1latzme6xf6s8tsrymuu6laf2ks2humqvdq39v8) in `euler-6` network. The second transaction is the cashback bonus for evangelists. The teams incentives, outlined in our [documents](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/teams/incentives.md), will also be included in that transaction.

## CYB tokens

Some discipline rewards were dependent on the takeoff results:

|Discipline|\~ GCYB|
|---|---:|
|relevance|1006|
|load|503|
|delegation|251|
|lifetime|151|
|total|1911|

The result of 2 (of 7) disciplines (full validator set and the community pool) will remain unknown until the end of the [Game of Links](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/). This means that the final results are actually intermediate results of Cyber's takeoff distribution.

According to paragraph 17 of the Game of Links and Cybers [whitepaper](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber/blob/master/cyber.pdf):

> All CYB tokens that remain from the Takeoff, are allocated to the community pool at the end of the game. All CYB tokens that remain from the disciplines are allocated to cyber\~Congress.

Distribution of a PoS-like blockchain is pretty complex. Currently, we have distributed 27.21% of the initial mainnet supply and this just the beginning:

The closing price of the round is 1.485 ATOM/GCYB. This means that we're closing the takeoff donation round with a market cap of \~ 1,485,000 ATOMs or \~ 13,384.706 ETH. We plan to head into the next distribution round at \~ 66,925 ETH market cap, which will place the price at 0.066925 ETH/GCYB.

Our theory that public funding is not optimal for the initial distribution, has been proven by this round. We are going to significantly update the following distribution rounds.

## The final

According to the rules of the Game of Links, the final of the game should start after the end of the takeoff and last for a period of 21 days. In the coming weeks, we will publish a governance proposal for updating provisions and further details.

At the time of the final, you should play at your best if you want to get your hands on more distribution of the future mainnet. Distributed EUL tokens can help you to achieve your challenges and will probably play a significant role in the results of the Game.

Good luck masters and heroes! Code speed.
