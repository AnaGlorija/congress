The takeoff donation round is over! A huge thank you and a shoutout to all those that took part in the donation round, your contribution to the Great Web is more than just significant!

- 15,088.40963 ATOM out of 300,000 have been donated. This accounts for 5.03% out of the desired sum
- 56 Cosmos addresses participated in the takeoff and won \~1911 GCYB out of 100,000

Thanks to your contribution cyberCongress was able to function since Apr 2020. After payouts to evangelists and team we will be able to sustain the team until Mar 2021. Of course that is not we expected, but its definitely not the zero. In the takeoff round founders investments was about half of the total raised which is big step for us. For us this is a proof that we are heading in the right direction.

## EUL tokens

According to Cybers [whitepaper](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber/blob/master/cyber.pdf) :

> In addition to CYB tokens, Game of Links allocates test EUL tokens to all Takeoff donors for the final

This means a bonus for the donors in EUL tokens proportionally donated ATOMs. EUL tokens will be distributed from cyber\~Congress [multisig address](https://cyber.page/network/euler/contract/cyber1latzme6xf6s8tsrymuu6laf2ks2humqvdq39v8) in `euler-6` network. The second transaction is the cashback bonus for evangelists. The teams incentives, outlined in our [documents](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/teams/incentives.md), will also be included in that transaction.

## CYB tokens

As you know payout amounts in disciplines were dependent on the takeoff results:

|Discipline|\~ GCYB|
|---|---:|
|relevance|1006|
|load|503|
|delegation|251|
|lifetime|151|
|total|1911|

The result of 2 (of 7) disciplines (full validator set and the community pool) will remain unknown until the end of the [Game of Links](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/). This means that the final results are actually intermediate results of Cyber's mainnet distribution.

According to paragraph 17 of the Game of Links and Cybers [whitepaper](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber/blob/master/cyber.pdf):

> All CYB tokens that remain from the Takeoff, are allocated to the community pool at the end of the game. All CYB tokens that remain from the disciplines are allocated to cyber\~Congress.

Distribution of a PoS-like blockchain is pretty complex. Currently, we have distributed 27.21% of the initial mainnet supply and this just the beginning:

The current price of the round is 1.485 ATOM/GCYB. This means that we're closing the takeoff donation round with a market cap of \~ 1,485,000 ATOMs or \~ 13,384.706 ETH. That means that if the next rounds will start at \~ 66,925 ETH market cap and the price will be at least 0.066925 ETH/GCYB.

As we learned from the takeoff public funding is not optimal they of initial distribution. We are going significantly update the distribution soon.

## The final

According to the Game of Links rules, the final of the game should start after the end of takeoff and to last for 21 days. We will publish a proposal for updating this provision, details soon. 

At the time of the final, you should play as strong as you can to get shares of the future mainnet. Distributed EUL tokens can help you to achieve your challenges and probably make a significant role in the Game results. 

Good luck masters and heroes!
