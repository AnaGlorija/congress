The takeoff donation round is over. Thanks to all participants. Your contribution to the Great Web is significant! It should be noted that the result of the takeoff round far from expected but this is not a challenge for the team and community to move forward.

So.

- <12,707.91558> ATOMs of 300,000 have been donated and this is <4.23%> of desirable.
- <50> cosmos addresses participated in the takeoff and won <10518.2451> GCYBs of 100000.
- Also, those <50> addresses won <1,609.6693068> GCYBs of 38000 for Game of Links players in disciplines depends on takeoff

In details:
- relevance: <847.1944> GCYBs
- load: <423.5972> GCYBs
- delegation: <211.7986> GCYBs
- lifetime: <127.0791> GCYBs

However, 2 of 7 disciplines' (spoiler: full validator set and the community pool) results unknown till the end of Game of Links and we can't announce the final results of the distribution but we can offer intermediate results of `cyber` mainnet distribution.

According to paragraph 17 `Game of Links` of `cyber` [whitepaper]():

> All CYB tokens that remain from the Takeoff, are allocated to the community pool at the end of the game. All CYB tokens that remain from the disciplines are allocated to cyber\~Congress.

This way we can show the current and NOT FINAL version of `cyber` distribution:

|Allocation|Tokens initial GCYBs|%|Tokens current GCYBs|%|Commnet|
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
|THC stakers (excluding congress)|600,000|60.00|600,000|60.00|CYB tokens to future THC stakers in 1 to 1 ratio|
|Cyber\~Congress|150,000|15.00|150,000 + 36390.33 = 186,390.33|18.64|cyber\~Congress tokens in THC ( +remaining from disciplines in CYBs only)|
|Takeoff|100,000|10.00|10,518.25|1.05|takeoff CYBs distribution|
|Gift|100,000|10.00|100,000|10.00|CYB tokens for `ethereum`, `cosmos` and `urbit` communities|
|Disciplines depending on takeoff |38,000|3.80|1,609.67|0.16|rewards for Game of Links players in takeoff dependent disciplines|
|Euler-4 rewards|5,000|0.50|5,000|0.50|lifetime rewards for euler-4 early validators|
|Full validators set|5,000|0.50|5,000|0.50|takeoff independent discipline, still playing|
|Community poll discipline|2,000|0.20|2,000|0.20|takeoff independent discipline, still playing|
|Goverment (community pool)|0|0.00|0 + 89,481.75 = 89,481.75|8.95|initial balance of community pool at `cyber` mainnet launch|
|***Total***|1,000,000|100.00|1,000,000|100.00| 1 PetaCYB or 1,000,000,000,000,000 CYBs supply of the mainnet|

Distribution in PoS-like blockchain is pretty complex. Currently, we distributed only 11.7% of the initial mainnet supply and this is only beginning. 10% of 11.7 was like `zerg-rush` for communities and only 1.7% is Sacred Graal. In that 1.7% the most strong and powerful community ever. They played and built a network with us.

Thanks to all participants and contributors. Get ready for the Final of the Game of Links!
