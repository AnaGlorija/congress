The takeoff donation round is over! A huge thank you and a shoutout to all those that took part in the donation round, your contribution to the Great Web is more than just significant!

- 12,707.91558 ATOM out of 300,000 have been donated. This accounts for 4.23% out of the desired sum
- 50 Cosmos addresses participated in the takeoff and won 10,518.2451 GCYBs out of 100,000
- The same 50 addresses won  1,609.6693068  GCYBs out of 38,000 in the takeoff discipline of the Game of Links

For reference: 1 GCYB is 1 billion CYB or 1,000,000,000 CYB

A detailed breakdown by discipline:
- relevance: 847.1944 GCYBs
- load: 423.5972 GCYBs
- delegation: 211.7986 GCYBs
- lifetime: 127.0791 GCYBs

The current price of the round is 1.42 ATOM/GCYB.  This means that we're closing the takeoff donation round with a market cap of \~ 1,420,000 ATOMs

The result of 2 (of 7) disciplines (full validator set and the community pool) will remain unknown until the end of the [Game of Links](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/). This means that the final results are actually intermediate results of Cyber's mainnet distribution.

According to paragraph 17 of the Game of Links and Cybers [whitepaper](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber/blob/master/cyber.pdf):

> All CYB tokens that remain from the Takeoff, are allocated to the community pool at the end of the game. All CYB tokens that remain from the disciplines are allocated to cyber\~Congress.

This means that the outlined results are not final:

|Allocation| Initial GCYB allocation|%|Current GCYB allocation|%|Comments|
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
|THC stakers (excluding congress)|600,000|60.00|600,000|60.00|CYB tokens to future THC stakers, based on a 1 to 1 ratio|
|Cyber\~Congress|150,000|15.00|150,000 + 36390.33 = 186,390.33|18.64|THC allocated to cyber\~Congress  + the remaining CYB tokens from the disciplines in accordance to paragraph 17|
|Takeoff|100,000|10.00|10,518.25|1.05|CYB takeoff distribution|
|Gift|100,000|10.00|100,000|10.00|CYB tokens for `Ethereum`, `Cosmos` and `Urbit` communities|
|Disciplines depending on takeoff |38,000|3.80|1,609.67|0.16|rewards for Game of Links players in takeoff dependent disciplines|
|Euler-4 rewards|5,000|0.50|5,000|0.50|lifetime rewards for euler-4 early validators|
|Full validators set|5,000|0.50|5,000|0.50|independent discipline, still playing|
|Community poll discipline|2,000|0.20|2,000|0.20|independent discipline, still playing|
|Government (community pool)|0|0.00|0 + 89,481.75 = 89,481.75|8.95|initial balance of the community pool at launch, due to paragraph 17|
|***Total***|1,000,000|100.00|1,000,000|100.00| 1 PetaCYB or 1,000,000,000,000,000 CYBs supply of the mainnet|

Distribution of a PoS-like blockchain is pretty complex. Currently, we have distributed 11.7% of the initial mainnet supply and this just the beginning.

10% of 11.7 was like `zerg-rush` for communities and only 1.7% is Sacred Graal. In that 1.7% the most strong and powerful community ever. They played and built a network with us.

According to the [whitepaper](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber/blob/master/cyber.pdf), 2 extra transactions will take place:

> In addition to CYB tokens, Game of Links allocates test EUL tokens to all Takeoff donors for the final

This means a bonus for the donors in EUL tokens. The second transaction is the cashback bonus for evangelists. The teams incentives, outlined in our [documents](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/teams/incentives.md), will also be included in that transaction.

After the transactions will be broadcasted on our canary network, `euler-6`, the final of the Game of Links will kick off. There will be 21 days before it ends, in which you can link and take part in the other remaining disciplines to earn more CYB.

Thanks to all participants and contributors. Get ready for the Final of the Game of Links!
