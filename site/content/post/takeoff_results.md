The takeoff donation round is over! A huge thank you and a shoutout to all those that took part in the donation round, your contribution to the Great Web is more than just significant!

- 12,707.91558 ATOM out of 300,000 have been donated. This accounts for 4.23% out of the desired sum
- 50 Cosmos addresses participated in the takeoff and won 10,518.2451 GCYBs out of 100,000

Thanks to your contribution cyberCongress was able to function since Apr 2020. After payouts to evangelists and team we will be able to sustain the team until Mar 2021. Of course that is not we expected, but its definitely not the zero. In the takeoff round founders investments was about half of the total raised which is big step for us. For us this is a proof that we are heading in the right direction.

## EUL tokens

> In addition to CYB tokens, Game of Links allocates test EUL tokens to all Takeoff donors for the final
> 
Мы распределяем токены для игры с такого то адреса. Сколько токенов. Напомианаем что теперь финал в полном разгаре.

This means a bonus for the donors in EUL tokens. The second transaction is the cashback bonus for evangelists. The teams incentives, outlined in our [documents](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/teams/incentives.md), will also be included in that transaction.

## CYB tokens

As you know payout amounts in disciplines were dependent on the takeoff results.  

//table
- relevance:    ~ 847 GCYB
- load:         ~ 423 GCYB
- delegation:   ~ 211 GCYB
- lifetime:     ~ 127 GCYB
total ...

The current price of the round is 1.42 ATOM/GCYB.  This means that we're closing the takeoff donation round with a market cap of \~ 1,420,000 ATOMs. Valuation in ETH. That means that if the next rounds ... the price will be at least ...


The result of 2 (of 7) disciplines (full validator set and the community pool) will remain unknown until the end of the [Game of Links](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/). This means that the final results are actually intermediate results of Cyber's mainnet distribution.

According to paragraph 17 of the Game of Links and Cybers [whitepaper](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber/blob/master/cyber.pdf):

> All CYB tokens that remain from the Takeoff, are allocated to the community pool at the end of the game. All CYB tokens that remain from the disciplines are allocated to cyber\~Congress.

Distribution of a PoS-like blockchain is pretty complex. Currently, we have distributed __% of the initial mainnet supply and this just the beginning.

Бублик Distributed/Distributed

As we learned from the takeoff public funding is not optimal they of initial distribution. We are going significantly update the distribution soon.
