The takeoff donation round is over! A huge thank you and a shoutout to all those that took part in the donation round, your contribution to the Great Web is more than just significant!

- `15,088.40963` ATOM out of `300,000` have been donated. This accounts for `5.03%` out of the target sum
- `56` Cosmos addresses participated in the takeoff and won `~12,1` TCYB out of `100` TCYB
- Rewards for disciplines dependent on takeoff results are `~1.9` TCYB out of `38` TCYB
- `56` Cosmos addresses participated in the takeoff and receive `~100` TEUL out of `~240` TEUL for Game of Links final

Thanks to your contributions the cyber~Congress was able to function since Apr 2020. After payouts to evangelists and the team, we will be able to sustain the DAO until Mar 2021. Of course, that is not what we dreamt of, but its definitely not zero. During takeoff about half was donated by DAO members and their friends. The other half was donated by our awesome community. To us, this is proof that we are heading in the right direction. May the force be with you.

## EUL tokens

According to Cybers [whitepaper](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber/blob/master/cyber.pdf) :

> In addition to CYB tokens, Game of Links allocates test EUL tokens to all Takeoff donors for the final

This means an extra bonus for donors, paid out in EUL tokens proportionally per the donated ATOMs. EUL tokens are distributed from cyber\~Congress [multisig address](https://cyber.page/network/euler/contract/cyber1latzme6xf6s8tsrymuu6laf2ks2humqvdq39v8) in `euler-6` network. Check your balances.

The second transaction is the cashback bonus for evangelists. The teams incentives, outlined in our [documents](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/teams/incentives.md), will also be included in that transaction.

## CYB tokens

Some discipline rewards were dependent on the takeoff results:

|Discipline|\~ GCYB|
|---|---:|
|takeoff|1006|
|relevance|1006|
|load|503|
|delegation|251|
|lifetime|151|
|total|1911|

The result of two disciplines, full validator set and the community pool, will remain unknown until the end of the [Game of Links](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/).

According to paragraph 17 of the Game of Links and Cybers [whitepaper](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber/blob/master/cyber.pdf):

> All CYB tokens that remain from the Takeoff, are allocated to the community pool at the end of the game. All CYB tokens that remain from the disciplines are allocated to cyber\~Congress.

The closing price of the round is `1.485` ATOM/GCYB. This means that we're closing the takeoff donation round with a market cap of `~1,485,000` ATOMs or ~ `13,384` ETH. The price of the GCYB at the end of takeoff is `0.013385` ETH.

Distribution of a PoS-like blockchain is pretty complex. Currently, we have distributed 27.21% of the genesis supply.

Key finding from the takeoff is that public funding is not optimal for the initial distribution. So we are going to significantly update the distribution rules.

## The final

According to the rules of the Game of Links, the final of the game should start after the end of the takeoff and last for a period of 21 days. But we feel that it needs more time. Soon, we will publish a governance proposal for updating provisions and further details.

At the time of the final, you should play at your best if you want to get your hands on more distribution of the future mainnet. Distributed EUL tokens can help you to achieve your challenges and will probably play a significant role in the results of the Game.

Good luck Heroes and Masters of the Great Web! Code speed.
