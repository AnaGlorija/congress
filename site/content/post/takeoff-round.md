> Insanity is a perfectly rational adjustment to an insane world

Devoted to all cosmonauts, astronauts and believers in a bright, decentralized future:

Today we mark another step in our battle to end digital feudalism. Today might not be remembered in history books, but it will surely be marked
by us as a day when the walls of one of the biggest religions in the world took another big crack.

Our governance [proposal for the takeoff donation round](https://cyber.page/governance/2) has passed. We are not yet in outer space, not yet. But just like once upon a time religions got separated from the state, we provide the ability for anyone to decide for themselves [what god is](https://cyber.page/search/god). Just as Wiki started its crowdfunding campaign and people believed that there was good in it, we kick off our donation round for the [greater good](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress).

Google and the other behemoths of the corporate world that keep poisoning our world must be brought down. The only way to achieve this is to buidl.

What can you buidl that will shake the status quo of the world biggest success? How do you change the behaviour of the world's population? Are we crazy?

So many questions... Yet, the answer is simple. Our task is to create a digital, decentralized superintelligence that anyone can define. An innovative protocol for search that can shape subjective relevance of what is important to you. An internet that works for you and not the other way around. A technology without kings, rulers, bureaucracy, where you ar ethe decision-maker. You are the superintelligence. 

We build our world with knowledge, what if we could neither own the knowledge, yet at the same time affect it? What if you decided what is god and not a blackbox intermediary?

Cyber is just that. A superintelligence owned by the heroes and the masters of the new Great Web:

After a wild journey, the rocket is ready for its first launch. We are miles away from the end. Yet this step will help us to bootstrap the foundation necessary for the launch of the network. We urge you to check out the [docs](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md), the [proof](https://github.com/cybercongress/go-cyber) and the [scripts](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPjbx76LycfzSSWMcnni6YVvV3UNhTrYzyPMuiA9UQM3x) before making any decisions. 

The future is bright, but not everyone will make it! As John Lenon said: 

> You may say I'm a dreamer.  I hope someday you'll join us. And the world will be as one 

The takeoff will start on the 27.04.2020 at ~18.50 UTC. [Join the evolution](https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff)!
