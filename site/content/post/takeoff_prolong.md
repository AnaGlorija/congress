Sure, more of you paid attention to takeoff donation round prolong. It should be over in the middle of October and the Final round should start, but [community decided](https://cyber.page/governance/11) to finish donations with a beautiful date. It's supposed to finish the Game of Links exactly after a year of playing. A year is a long time for making a clear conclusion about the Game, community, devs, and finalize the next development vectors. 

This way the takeoff donation round will finish on Dec 1, 2020, 00.00.00 UTC. It means the Game of Links go in the Final round status for 21 days and then will be finished. Reminder. The final round of the Game of Links is the time when we will unleash EUL tokens to donors. It should be time to make crazy things with unlimited power and make a significant influence on the Game. 

As described in [the Game of Links rules](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/) we'll distribute EUL tokens for all donors after takeoff ends and then, 21+ days after, we'll publish the Game of Links results. Those results will be included in the mainnet. 

Stay home and play in the Game of Links ðŸ™‚
