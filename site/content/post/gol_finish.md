More than a year passed after the `euler-6` launch and we're ready to introduce a proposal for the Game of Links closing for `bostrom` canary network launch and moving on.

Therefore the proposal is:

1. Close the Game of Links at 6,270,000 block height (the June 9-10)
2. Provide tools and information about the Game of Links distribution not later than 7 days after closing
3. In case if `euler-6` stuck early than 6,270,000 block height, close the Game of Links on the stucked blockheight
