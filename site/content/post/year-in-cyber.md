## Intro
Cyber has had a very productive and full of events 2020. Here, at [cyber/~Congress](https://client.aragon.org/#/cybercongress) (the launching DAO behind Cyber), we have decided to put together a short review of these events.

Before we move on, we would like to take a minute to thank everyone who has been supporting us. Whether by helping to test the network as a validator, creating cyberlinks as a user, or helping us at cyber/~Congress, by participating in the [takeoff donation round](https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff). Taking the time to complete our silly (but useful) bounties, voting on proposals, talking in chats, following our Twitter account, or simply, if you did anything this year to #fuckgoogle - We wish all of you the happiest holiday season and a very open-source and a productive 2021!

## Cyber?
The biggest question of the year (and for us as a team too) has been this: `what is Cyber`? What is its purpose and where are we headed? Of course, internally, we know the answers, but we have had difficulty sharing across our message. We have tried to pinpoint our product market fit several times. So far, without success. Considering our previous blockchain experience, we knew this isn't going to be an easy ride. But we were surprised to learn how difficult it is to find a market fit for software that is trying to solve a real world issue.

So, what is Cyber?

Thanks, to one of our bounties, one of Cyber's users, has put together [a short 45-second overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTrGJRM6IME). We think that it is the best attempt at explaining Cyber so far, in such a short period of time.

Cyber is a decentralized computer. It is a piece of software, buggy, yet already proven to work software. It is designed to do one thing: answer questions. One might ask why? Why do I need software that answers questions? Well. That's a great question. We believe that there is no harm in asking questions. Asking questions is what, often, separates us as humans from other species (not just this, but this also).

The issue arises when questions are attempted to be answered. We think that answers should be free of blackbox, intermediary opinions. Answers should be free of censorship and bureaucratic hassle. Blockchain technology and game theory provide a great deal of progress in creating a specialized piece of software that can answer questions in a decentralized manner.

Cyber is a software 2.0 protocol that has 2 working apps on top of it already (just like the Ethereum protocol has apps like Uniswap, for example). Both of those apps are open-source and fully functioning at [cyber.page](https://cyber.page/). They are a decentralized analogue of a search engine (searching, querying and indexing content within user-delivered p2p networks, with the help of IPFS) and a decentralized analogue of Twitter, that works with the help of cyberlinks, and allows for military-grade security and twits with the help of web3 signers (such as a Ledger device or a web3 browser extension, such as Keplr) and without such BS, as emails and ads.

Cyber's computer is shaped as a superintelligent organism. A computer that, in the blockchain space, would be labeled as a consensus computer, for answers. Cyber is managed by its users and token holders without any jurisdictions and CEO’s. It is structured as artificial intelligence, in that it can provide answers to questions from the derived information taught to it by its users. It learns from the collective mind, free from intermediary opinions and answers without censoring any of the answer itself.

With the help of cyberlinks, blockchain, IPFS, Tendermint, Aragon, cryptography and other, distributed, technology, Cyber can index and rank data, which removes blackbox, intermediary opinions in the formation of the semantics core of the internet. This helps to decentralize the infrastructure of the upcoming Great Web.

Cyber allows to design a trustless, provable and an incentivized method of communication between those who provide content and those searching for it. Effectively removing censorship and creating a world of opportunities for such fields as, open AI, digital marketing, social networks, search mechanisms, decentralized oracles and much more.

Cyber is currently working on autonomous and programmable smart contracts, which will take it another step closer to becoming a superintelligence. Cyber has 2 DAO’s which help to manage it. A community pool and a programmable chain on top of the Tendermint consensus. Where users can manage the chain, vote on its parameters, its inflation, etc. And an Aragon, ETH-based DAO, which acts as a decentralized venture fund and bank for Cyber. Hence, separating money (ETH) managed by the users and the state (the chain).

Is this very long to explain what Cyber does? Yes, it is. But we progress. And what we can't explain in 45 seconds, seems that our users can.

As we progress into 2021, you can expect lots of new releases, ideas, upgrades, DAO interactions, self sustained smart contracts, new proposals, gamification, bug fixes and hopefully, a mainet. Will Cyber launch in 2021? We surely hope so. Our task is to deliver self-sustainble, decentralized piece of working software that can solve a world renowned issue: decentralize the core of the internet, and we have no issue with coming late to the party, yet making a good entrance.

What did happen in Cyber over 202? Well, quite a lot, here are some of the main events that occurred over the course of the last year:

### [2019.12.19 Euler-5 and the Game of Links launch](https://cybercongress.ai/euler-5-launch/)
This is cheating, we know. But the event happened so close to 2020 that we decided to include it.

This event marked our transition from virtually stellar mode (although we were open-source since day 0) to going into a more public mode. We launched our first, large, public incentivized testent and did it (not with hookers, blackjack and all of that, although I personally, can't promise that no immoral deeds occurred) [live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpoKq-fCXhM&list=PLOcP3DXQoNUXmh7ob0Fm6p12L20zn0zbT&index=8)!

The event, of course, marked the beginning of the first large distribution round, the Game of Links. The game plays a major role for the distribution of our mainet token, as it awards those who help to build the network and believe in what Cyber does from day one.

### [2019.12.20 Euler-5 release. Episode I: a new hope](https://cybercongress.ai/euler-5-release/)

### [2020.02.24 first critical bug](https://cybercongress.ai/euler-6-migration/)

### 2020.04.04 Euler-6 launch

### [2020.04.25 takeoff proposal](https://cyber.page/governance/2)

## [2020.05.10 upgrade takeoff](https://cyber.page/governance/5)

### [2020.05.21 proposal to cosmos](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/26)
One of my favorite times of 2020. Yes, I am biased. This was the first attempt at decentralized venture capital across the blockchain space, a little before the DeFi craze actually occured.

As a DAO, we proposed to sell part of our mainet tokens to the Cosmos hub (in an exchange for some ATOM tokens and the future IBC) and created an onchain governance proposal for this. It was crazy, the first public Cosmos-SDK chain AMA on Cosmos TG, a fortnight of Q&A, and... and, alas, the proposal didn't go thorough. I don't think this is the right place to call for judgments, so I won't. But we are glad that we did this and many lessons were learned, hopefully not just by us, but by everyone. And, yes, you may (almost defiantly) expect Cyber to repeat this attempt in 2021.

### [2020.07.22 onchain upgrade Darwin](https://cybercongress.ai/darwin-upgrade/)
