title: 'Proposal #. Bostrom pre-network launch'
author: savetheales

Bostrom canary network is coming and cyber~Congress team want to propose the protocol for Game of Links ending, `pre-bostrom` and `bostrom` networks launching.

1. Start `pre-bostrom` network as soon as it ready for launch. 
2. During 5 days after launch submit a proposal to end the Game of Links in 3 weeks. Define the last block for the Game of Links. 
3. Incentivise the `pre-bostrom` network for validating with 150 GCYBs by the `lifetime` discipline protocol. 
4. Set the maximum time for `pre-bostrom` running 3 months.
5. If the `bostrom` canary network not ready for launch in 3 months add additional GCYBs as an incentive to validators by proposal in `pre-bostrom` network.

*Rationale:*  The `euler-6` network and the Game of Links have exhausted and the cyber~Congress team intends to move on with the brand new network. The launch is a complex task and that why we want to test the network before the canary network launch. The best option for testing is bringing to the community the working network. We chose the way with running incentivized `pre-network` release for collecting and fixing bugs and, also, for defining the network params.
 
After the defined block in point 2, the `euler-6` network will die organically without any incentives to validate. And only one network will be running - `pre-bostrom`. We're expecting less than 3 months for testing all modules in `pre-bostrom`, but if something goes wrong we'll increase the bounty for `pre-bostrom` validating. In the case of the relaunch, the validators pre-commits will be sum as it was during `euler-5` and `euler-6`.
