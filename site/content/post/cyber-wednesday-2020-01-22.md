**cyber~Wednesday Day 0**

Welcome to the new bi-weekly report format from cyber!

As most of you know, previously we used to report weekly in our [TG channel](https://t.me/fuckgoogle) in an open format. But nothing lasts forever and its time to move to a new format. An asynchronous format that will:

- Eliminate the need for a monolithic team leader
- Make the report more interactive to the public
- Include more information from each full-time member of the team
- Be more efficient and creative than before

Last week, we outlined a [new set of guidelines](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/teams/team%20reports.md) for the reports. Each report will be a combined work from the team. It will be pushed to our GitHub and thereafter published for AMA (ask me anything) on the #fuckgoogle [TG channel](https://t.me/fuckgoogle). For now, questions from the community will be answered openly in the channel.

## Cyber bi-weekly report 2020.01.22

### @serejandmyself
Over the past few weeks, we have been publishing quite a lot of content in several crypto-related media channels. Those include
hackernoon, publish0x, bitcoinews and others. A topic for mentions of cyber has been created and I would appreciate it if
anyone that sees cyber mentioned out in the wild hits that topic with a reply. Remember that any topic is a fair game. You can see
the full list of mention [here](https://ai.cybercongress.ai/t/mentions-of-the-beast-in-the-wild-any-links-that-mention-cyber-cyb-etc-are-a-fair-game/40). From the list, you might also notice that we have been mentioned in several awesome lists, IPFS blog and given
several interviews.

One of the major things to happen was taking part in [36c3](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2019/wiki/index.php/Main_Page), as part of the CDC cluster and giving a [speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc51zyflpa8) there. We also recorded
an interview for [Monero talk](https://www.monerotalk.live/) and waiting for it to come out on a few weeks. I have re-organised one of the ecosystem [main tasks](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues/289), which is the community partnership task. The reason there is no V's there, as that this is an ongoing task, and anyone is welcome to participate in it.

We have started several new topics on different crypto-related forums. A full list can be seen [here](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/tree/master/ecosystem/profiles). You are welcome to participate. We also hit the [trending spot](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/comments/en6qbn/data_is_the_new_gold_unfortunately_in_todays/) with some of our article on the privacytools subreddit, which was cool!

The [ELI-5 FAQ](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/ELI-5%20FAQ.md) has been updated and a few more new documents have been created, for example, the [gift FAQ](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Gift%20FAQ%20and%20general%20gift%20information.md). We tested spreading out the news about the gift, but as that's not the main task right now, we stopped with that for the time being. The main task is, of course, a bigger validator pool. For this task, I am trying to make contact with already existing validators across the cosmos ecosystem and even beyond it. For example, you may find posts for the [Grin](https://forum.grin.mw/t/a-shout-out-to-the-miners-of-grin-uncategorized-because-its-not-about-mining-grin-directly/6966) and the [Cortex mining](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cortex_Official/comments/erbuw3/off_topic_calling_out_to_cortex_miners/) communities as a call to diversify their computation power.

Thanks to [TodayInCosomos](https://twitter.com/adriana_kalpa) we have become quite a regular mention on the agenda, this can be seen on Twitter. We will be grateful for reposts and comments from the community. I have submitted [several PR's](https://github.com/serejandmyself) to list cyber on different GitHub repos that might have our TA on them, and websites like [cryptomiso](https://www.cryptomiso.com/). We are in talks with several partners across the cosmos ecosystem that might help us to make our presence more established.

Considering this report oversees a few weeks of work over the holiday seasons, I might have missed some information and already completed tasks. But hopefully, this draws the larger picture, which shows that we are concentrated on specific TA for the moment: validators, cosmos awareness and awareness in specifically targeted communities. More on [ecosystem](https://github.com/cybercongress).  

### @savetheales
DONE:
- Developed backend for cyber.page euler-5 gift checker as IPLD structure
- Provided concept for gift conversion on mongodb and flaks stack
- Provided concept for the Game of Links personal and overall monitors with currently won balances
- Continued to research backend stack for game monitors 

TODO:
- Backend for the game monitors with WebSockets.   

### @xhipster

2. [Catching errors](https://github.com/cybercongress/dot-cyber/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aerror) in https://cyber.page based in the feedback

4. One more repetition of test~Foundation ceremony with @litvintech
5. Improvement of workflow development. Now we work with pull request only
6. Research of [Metamask](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension) and [in3](https://in3.readthedocs.io/en/develop/getting_started.html) codebase for better Cyb architecture
7. Some collaboration with @savethealse on the Game of Links monitor

Next week Ceremony and [next dot-cyber release](https://github.com/cybercongress/dot-cyber/projects/3) are in focus
