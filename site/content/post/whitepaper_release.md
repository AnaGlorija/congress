2019.12.01 @xhipster and @litvintech have released `cyber: Computing the knowledge of the Great Web` the whitepaper. This is the result of 3 years of painstaking work, discussions, and durability tests. 

This idea goes side by side with a ready implementation. The high risk to be misunderstood is a Great adherence to the principles.

We tried to at those 14 pages do our best... for shining :)

> We have the most complicated distribution of known by me projects. But it's beautiful.

Decentralization must be decentralized. And we have shown that in the distribution module!

We really love this doc and it is only just beginning.

Don’t believe, don’t fear, don’t ask.
