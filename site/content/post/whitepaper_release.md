2019.12.01 @xhipster and @litvintech have released `cyber: Computing the knowledge of the Great Web` the whitepaper. This is the result of 3 years of painstaking work, discussions, and durability tests. 

This is the idea side by side in implementation, the high risk to be misunderstandable and the Great adherence to the principles.

We tried to at those 14 pages do our best... for shining :)

> We have the most complicated distribution of known by me projects. But it's beautiful.

Decentralization must be decentralized. And we have shown that in the distribution module!  

> Now, with equations the whitepaper looks really serious! 

We really love this doc and it is only just beginning.

Don’t believe, don’t fear, don’t ask.
