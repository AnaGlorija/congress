2019.12.01 @xhipster and @litvintech have released [The whitepaper](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQ1Vong13MDNxixDyUdjniqqEj8sjuNEBYMyhQU4gQgq3) - `cyber: Computing the knowledge of the Great Web`. This is the result of 3 years of painstaking work, discussions, and durability tests. 

This idea goes side by side with a ready implementation. The high risk to be misunderstood is a Great adherence to the principles.

> Now, with the equations in place, the whitepaper looks really serious!

We really love this doc and this is only just beginning.

Don’t believe, don’t fear, don’t ask.
