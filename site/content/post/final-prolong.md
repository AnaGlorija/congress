December 3rd was an [outgoing transaction](https://cyber.page/network/euler/tx/21E2702B7A2A9754CA3770EB69D3740513A6C3C3D9F71F922E37C25CB6F0DB57) from cyber\~Congress multisig account with 56 addresses participated in the first step of takeoff donation round. According to the Game of Links rules, after distribution, the final of the Game of Links should start and was to last 21 days. The detailed results you can find in the [takeoff results](https://cybercongress.ai/takeoff-results/) article. But. We've investigated the results of the takeoff and define rationales for our next desirable steps:

***Thesis one:***  Prolong the final of the Game of Links till March 1st, 2021 00:00:00 UTC instead of December 25th, 2020, 00:00:00 UTC.

The rationale for the thesis:

1. We want to involve the Game all waves of users that come to our project last months. Organic distribution is a success key for blockchain project growth and we don't want to miss all of our future masters and heroes.

2. We find bugs in the app and in blockchain only thanks to our active community members. This is a long way to create a perfect project and this is the rationale why we should prolong the Final and keep a load on the network. Our next stage with `bostrom` canary network should be awesome!

***Thesis two:*** Increase rewards of disciplines relyed on takeoff results from the current value ~1.9 TCYB (0.19%) to 3.8 TCYB (0.38%) as incentives for players to play hard.

The rationale for the thesis: We expect more users this winter and players, as result. Since we want to increase the Final time playing it's obvious we need to increase rewards.

The text of #17 proposal in the `euler-6` network:

```
This proposal is about the Game of Links Final prolongation and increasing rewards for takeoff relyed disciplines.
That means that the results of this proposal to impact the Game of Links provisions and final distribution.

By voting "yes" I agree that:

1. The end of the Game of Links Final will be on March 1st, 2021 00:00:00 UTC
2. The reward of disciplines relyed on the takeoff will be increased from the current value ~1.9 TCYB (0.19%) to 3.8 TCYB (0.38%)
