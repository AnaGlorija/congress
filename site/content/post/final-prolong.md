December 3rd was an [outgoing transaction](https://cyber.page/network/euler/tx/21E2702B7A2A9754CA3770EB69D3740513A6C3C3D9F71F922E37C25CB6F0DB57) from cyber\~Congress multisig account with 56 addresses participated in the first step of takeoff donation round. According to the Game of Links rules, after distribution, the final of the Game of Links should start and was to last 21 days. The detailed results you can find in the [takeoff results](https://cybercongress.ai/takeoff-results/) article. But. We've investigated the results of the takeoff and define rationales for our next desirable steps:

***Thesis one:***  Prolong the final of the Game of Links till March 1st, 2021 00:00:00 UTC instead of December 25th, 2020, 00:00:00 UTC.

The rationale for the thesis:

1. We find bugs in the app and in blockchain only thanks to our active community members. This is a long way to create a perfect project and this is the rationale why we should prolong the Final and keep a load on the network. Our next stage with `bostrom` canary network should be awesome! That why we should prolong network support till at least March 1st. If it feels not enough we'll propose one more prolongation with updated distribution params.

2. We want to involve the Game all waves of users that come to our project last months. Organic distribution is a success key for blockchain project growth and we don't want to miss all of our future masters and heroes.

***Thesis two:*** Increase rewards of disciplines relyed on takeoff results from the current value ~1.9 TCYB (0.19%) to 3.8 TCYB (0.38%) as incentives for players to play hard.

The rationale for the thesis: We expect more users this winter and players, as result. Since we want to increase the Final time playing it's obvious we need to increase rewards.

***Thesis three:*** `Full validator set` discipline update. The [rules](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/) of this discipline are:

> If the set of validators will increase to or is equal or over 100, and this number of validators can last for 10,000 blocks, we will allocate an additional 2 TCYB to validators who took part in this discipline and were active in the 10,000 blocks period. If the number of validators will increase to or is over 146, under the same conditions we will allocate an additional 3 TCYB. The rewards in that discipline will be distributed to validators proportionally to their pre-commits from the CURRENT network start, up until the discipline is complete.

The rationale for the thesis: It was agreed that in the current condition this discipline is virtually impossible to achieve. A nice way to solve it to calibrate this discipline by the following values:

``` bash
1 TCYB if 42 validators
+1 TCYB if 73 validators
+1 TCYB if 100 validators
+2 TCYB if 146 validators

Total: 5 TCYB
```

Thus the description of the `full validator set` discipline will be:

> If the set of validators will increase to or is equal or over 42, and this number of validators can last for 10,000 blocks, we will allocate a 1 TCYB to validators who took part in this discipline and were active in the 10,000 blocks period. If the number of validators will increase to or is over 73, under the same conditions we will allocate an additional 1 TCYB. If the number of validators will increase to or is over 100, under the same conditions we will allocate one more additional 1 TCYB.  Finally, if the number of validators will increase to or is over 146, under the same conditions we will allocate an additional 2 TCYB. The rewards in that discipline will be distributed to validators proportionally to their pre-commits from the CURRENT network start, up until the discipline is complete.

The text of #17 proposal in the `euler-6` network:

This proposal is about the Game of Links Final prolongation, increasing rewards for takeoff relyed disciplines, and updating `full validator set` discipline provisions.
That means that the results of this proposal to impact the Game of Links provisions and final distribution.

By voting "yes" I agree that:

1. The end of the Game of Links Final will be on March 1st, 2021 00:00:00 UTC
2. The reward of disciplines relyed on the takeoff will be increased from the current value ~1.9 TCYB (0.19%) to 3.8 TCYB (0.38%)
3. The updated provisions of `full validator set` discipline will be:
If the set of validators will increase to or is equal or over 42, and this number of validators can last for 10,000 blocks, we will allocate a 1 TCYB to validators who took part in this discipline and were active in the 10,000 blocks period. If the number of validators will increase to or is over 73, under the same conditions we will allocate an additional 1 TCYB. If the number of validators will increase to or is over 100, under the same conditions we will allocate one more additional 1 TCYB.  Finally, if the number of validators will increase to or is over 146, under the same conditions we will allocate an additional 2 TCYB. The rewards in that discipline will be distributed to validators proportionally to their pre-commits from the CURRENT network start, up until the discipline is complete.
