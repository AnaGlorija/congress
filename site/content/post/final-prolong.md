December 3rd saw an [outgoing transaction](https://cyber.page/network/euler/tx/21E2702B7A2A9754CA3770EB69D3740513A6C3C3D9F71F922E37C25CB6F0DB57) from the cyber\~Congress multisig account, to over 56 addresses that participated in the first step of the takeoff donation round. According to the rules of the Game of Links, after the distribution, the final of the Game of Links should have started and was suppose to last for a period of 21 days. The [takeoff results](https://cybercongress.ai/takeoff-results/) can be found in this article.

But... We've investigated the results of the takeoff and have defined some rationale, for the next desirable steps:

***Thesis one:*** 
Prolong the final of the Game of Links till March 1st, 2021 00:00:00 UTC instead of December 25th, 2020, 00:00:00 UTC.

*The rationale of the thesis:* our next stage, with the `bostrom` canary network is going to be awesome! That is why we believe that we should prolong the support of the network, till at least, March 1st. If this doesn't feel like enough, when time comes, we will propose one more prolongation, with updated distribution params. We want to include all the new players that have joined Cyber over the last few months. Organic distribution is a success key for the growth of a blockchain project, and we don't want to miss all of our future masters and heroes.

***Thesis two:***
Increase the rewards for disciplines dependent on takeoff results as an incentive for players to play better and stronger than ever.

*The rationale for the thesis:* we expect more users and players this winter as a result of our actions. Since we want to increase the time of the Final, it's obvious, that we also need to increase rewards.

***Thesis three:***
`Full validator set` discipline update. The [rules](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/) of this discipline should be changed.

*The rationale for the thesis:* it is obvious, that in the current conditions, this discipline is virtually impossible to achieve. A nice way to solve this, will be to calibrate this discipline.

The text of proposal #17 for `euler-6`:

This proposal is regarding the time adjustment of the final of the Game of Links, increasing rewards for takeoff related disciplines, and updating the provisions for the `full validator set` discipline.

This means, that the results of this proposal will impact the Game of Links provisions and the final distribution!

By voting "yes" I agree that:

1. The end of the Game of Links Final will be prolonged until March 1st, 2021 00:00:00 UTC
2. The reward of disciplines dependent on the takeoff, will be increased from the current value of ~1.9 TCYB (0.19%) to 3.8 TCYB (0.38%)
3. The updated provisions of the `full validator set` discipline:
If the set of validators will increase to or is equal to, or is over 42, and - this number of validators can hold for a period of 10,000 blocks, cyber~Congress will allocate 1 TCYB to the validators who took part in this discipline and were active in the period of those 10,000 blocks. If the number of validators will increase to, or is over 73, under the same conditions, we will allocate an additional 1 TCYB to the rewards. If the number of validators will increase to, or is over 100, under the same conditions we will allocate an additional 1 TCYB to the prize pool. 
Finally, if the number of validators will increase to, or is over 146, under the same conditions we will allocate an additional 2 TCYB to the prize pool. The rewards for this discipline will be distributed proportionally to the validators per their pre-commits from the start of the CURRENT network, up to the point when the discipline is considered done.
