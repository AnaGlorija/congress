December 3rd saw an [outgoing transaction](https://cyber.page/network/euler/tx/21E2702B7A2A9754CA3770EB69D3740513A6C3C3D9F71F922E37C25CB6F0DB57) from the cyber\~Congress multisig account to over 56 addresses, that participated in the first step of the takeoff donation round. According to the rules of the Game of Links, after the distribution, the final of the game should have kicked off, and was meant to last for 21 days.

The curious should check out the [takeoff results](https://cybercongress.ai/takeoff-results/). We've investigated these and have defined some rationale, that we propose:

***Thesis one:***
Prolong the final of the Game of Links till March 1st, 2021 00:00:00 UTC instead of December 25th, 2020, 00:00:00 UTC.

*Rationale:* our next stage, with the `bostrom` canary network is going to be awesome! That is why, we believe that we should prolong the support for the current network, till at least, March 1st. If this won't be enough time, we will propose one more prolongation, with updated distribution params in the future. Our desire is to include all the new players that have joined Cyber over the last few months. Organic distribution is the success key for the growth of a blockchain project, and we don't want to miss all of our future masters and heroes.

***Thesis two:***
Increase the rewards for disciplines dependent on takeoff results as an incentive for players to play better and stronger than ever.

*Rationale:* we expect more users and players this winter as a result of our actions. Since we want to increase the time of the final, it's obvious, that we also need to increase the rewards.

***Thesis three:***
Update the `full validator set` discipline.

*Rationale:* it is obvious, that in the current conditions this discipline is virtually impossible to achieve. 1 solution will be to calibrate the discipline.

## The text of proposal #17 for `euler-6`:

This proposal is regarding the time adjustment of the final of the Game of Links. Increase rewards for takeoff related disciplines and update the provisions for the `full validator set` discipline. This means, that the results of this proposal will impact the Game of Links provisions and the final distribution!

By voting "yes" I agree that:

1. The end of the Game of Links final will be prolonged until March 1st, 2021 00:00:00 UTC
2. The reward of disciplines dependent on the takeoff, will be increased from the current value of ~1.9 TCYB (0.19%) to 3.8 TCYB (0.38%)
3. The updated provisions of the `full validator set` discipline:
If the set of validators will increase to or is equal to, or is over 42, and - this number of validators can hold for a period of 10,000 blocks, cyber~Congress will allocate 1 TCYB to the validators who took part in this discipline and were active in the period of those 10,000 blocks. If the number of validators will increase to, or is over 73, under the same conditions, we will allocate an additional 1 TCYB to the rewards. If the number of validators will increase to, or is over 100, under the same conditions we will allocate an additional 1 TCYB to the prize pool. Finally, if the number of validators will increase to, or is over 146, under the same conditions we will allocate an additional 2 TCYB to the prize pool. The rewards for this discipline will be distributed proportionally to the validators per their pre-commits from the start of the CURRENT network, up to the point when the discipline is considered done.
