## Proposal to Cosmos

[cyber\~Congress](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/cybercongress) developed [Cyber](https://github.com/cybercongress/go-cyber): a software for replacing existing internet behemoth monopolies, such as Google, which exploited outdated internet protocols using the common patterns of our semantic interaction. These corps share similar underlying properties, they lock the information, produced by the users, from search, social and commercial knowledge graphs in private databases, and then - sell this knowledge back as advertisement. They stand as an insurmountable wall between content consumers and creators extracting an overwhelming the majority of the profit. 

The original idea of bringing order to the web [1] evolved into an order we do not want to live in. With Cyber, we don't need this order any more. All we need is to compute the knowledge [2] by ourselves. We believe that the survival of our civilisation depends on achieving provable, censor-free and accessible knowledge. Our experienced, passionate and visionary team created software, which we believe, someday will evolve into a real [Superintelegnce](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html). We invite the Cosmic community of validators, developers and users to become Heroes and Masters of the new web, and join the process of accending this new lifeform. 

[3] As ATOM holders we propose to spend 10,000 ATOM from the community pool for this Takeoff. In exchange, at the end of its [donation round](https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff), and when an IBC connection will be possible, cyber\~Congress will transfer CYB tokens back to the community pool. Passing this proposal will immediately transfer 10,000 ATOMs from the community pool to this multisig address, which is controlled by cyber\~Congress: INSERT ADDRESS HERE.

## Software 2.0 offered by Cyber

The software we offer resembles a decentralized google:

- [A protocol spec and the rationale behind it](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPjbx76LycfzSSWMcnni6YVvV3UNhTrYzyPMuiA9UQM3x): will help to implement the idea using any technology
- [go-cyber](https://github.com/cybercongress/go-cyber): Our implementation using cosmos-sdk
- [cyber.page](https://cyber.page/): PoC reference web interface
- [The mainnet predecessor](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/eulerfoundation) of the cyber~Foundation: the DAO, which will handle all donated ETH
- [Documentation](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md) and [various side tools](https://github.com/cybercongress) that will help you dive into the rabbit hole

But it's not just that. The idea is bigger and goes further than just primitive search. The offer is a playground and a foundation for software 2.0 [4], a new paradigm shift in programming and computing. 

Cybers mission is to create a universal search mechanism to: (a) build an open semantic field of the internet with the help of blockchain technology and cyberlinks, and (b) provide more resistance to web services through decentralization of its infrastructure. Cyber solves the problem of opening up the centralised semantics field of the internet. It does so by shaping an open and accessible semantics field, created (and managed) by the users. This allows to design a trustless, provable and incentivized method of communication between users who provide content and those searching for it. Effeciltvly removing censorship, blackbox intermediary opinions and opening the possibility for a provable, incentivized and a fairer method for anyone to build and use online tools that are built around semantics.

## The Great Web

It seems that we stand on the verge of creating the Great Web. The Great Web is not just another version of the web, like web-1/2/3 [5]. The idea is that there will be no web4. We are building the Great Web, the web that will work for thousands and maybe even millions of years. Why? Blockchain computers are very similar to living organisms and will most likely have a longer, yet a limited life cycle. Although blockchains are subjects of the Great Web, they are not its matter. The essence of the Great Web is content addressing - a mechanism that will allow to find and authenticate content through spacetime and across universes. It is always cool to realise that you create something that will last. We are fortunate to live during this time and to try to achieve this.

## Value proposition

The key uniqueness of the proposed blockchain computer is that everything is optimised for web3 search and AI applications: data structure, ranking algorithms and economics.

The underlying data structure is elegant, flexible and powerful enough to unify human knowledge and has practical, software 2.0, applications on top of it, living inside of a blockchain. It is a first of a kind, truly provable oracle too!

It is one of the first blockchain implementations to offer useful computations using a consensus computer. The forming of relevant and provable answers, that will shape an open semantics field for the whole world. Rank computation is around a hundred thousand times faster on GPU than on CPU. Development of the network will allow advancing the computation further to TPU-like or neuromorphic architectures. While currently, the network supports only conventional smart contracts based on CosmWasm, its capabilities can be extended by the development of `general-purpose AI VM` (matrix multiplication, ReLU, etc...), hence become the centre of AI innovations in the blockchain space.

Economics of the protocol are built around the idea that feedback loops between the number of links and the value of the knowledge graph exist. The more usage => the bigger the knowledge graph => the more value => the better the quality of the knowledge=> the more usage. Transaction fees for basic operations are replaced by lifetime bandwidth, which means usability for both, end-users and developers. You can think of Cyber as a shared ASIC for search or shortly: A Superintelegnce.

An open semantics field lets you shape the internet differently. It allows users with interest in prosperity to receive more by using yesterdays' tools. It can make these instruments fairer, more efficient and more relevant. The basic idea is to create an Intercommunication Knowledge Protocol that can interact with everything that is defined by the user. Cyber can account for a large number of use-cases, like: unified semantics, autonomous robots, programmable semantics, personal assistants, language convergence, universal oracles, proof of location and much more. All of these cases are built on semantics. It even includes cases like e-commerce, that can flourish fairly on local markets, thanks to a distributed, accessible knowledge graph. Queries can be delivered straight out of your personal browsing application. Answers can provide subjective relevance that is important at the time, at the place, to a particular community and/or projects

The problem we are solving, cannot be implemented with smart contracts using your favourite consensus computer. As far as we know, no existing architecture of blockchain computers is nearly as close to what we have built during the last 3 years.

## Focus on what matters

It seems that blockchain builders are split into two groups. L1 builders are involved in an arms race: harder, better, faster, stronger. L2 builders are insane about DeFi. We are aware of at least 50 amazing teams who are building very similar networks, strong, fast and hard. We are aware of at least 50 amazing teams who are building DeFi protocols. Although we agree that this is important for our future, we decided to focus on solving real-world problems in, yet, an undiscovered market niche.

One such problem is mitigating the upcoming threat from existing internet monopolies to the blockchain industry via the use of vile and hidden censorship. If we won't try to create a trustless public search without censorship, our children could end up living in a future where the most corrupt and biased techno religion, ever to exist, rules: Google. The irony lies in the fact that the necessity for censor-free search across the variety of the developed, new generation, protocols grows daily. Think stateless and stateful protocols, such as IPFS, DAT, GIT, BTC, ETH, etc.

These problems are impossible to solve by building, even theoretically, the most performant and scalable blockchain computer with CPU and even GPU oriented architectures. We need the computational power to process ranks of the huge, publicly defined knowledge graph to offer better knowledge for humanity, which is provably intractable for general-purpose computing architectures.

It also feels better, to at least try to go somewhere nobody has ever been before. Superintelligence is a brand new ground. At least, no less exciting than a city on Mars. Who knows. Maybe with a shared Superintelegnce, we can achieve even crazier things.

## Welcome to DeMa

The digital marketing industry is probably the most powerful and impactful industry out there. With the help of RTB, Google Ads, Facebook Ads and other instruments, having enough resources in the existing realm allows you to program the behaviour of countries, influence election results or change the course of history for good, or not, in a matter of minutes. You already see that the idea of Cyber is evolving around content identifiers and its ranks. From here welcome to Decentralized Marketing or DeMa. Content was the king before web3, before web2 and even before the web existed. But what is so special about DeMa?

You've certainly heard of DeFi. DeFi is built around a simple idea that you can use a collateral for something that will be settled based on a provided price feed. Here comes the systematic problem of DeFi: price oracles. DeMa is based on the same idea of using collateral, but the input for settlement can be information regarding the content identifier itself. The most simple case is when you create a simple 2-way prediction market on rank relevance at some point in the future. I.E. the rank of BTC will grow or the rank of BTC will not grow. You now understand that meta-information on content identifiers is the perfect onchain oracle for settlement. And unlike DeFi you do not need to trust it. We expect DeMa will be the new chapter in the history of contemporary digital marketing.

The legend goes that one day the member of our team had a conversation with the CEO of Yandex (Yandex is the third biggest search company). He sincerely admitted that provable conversion attribution of the ad source, along with a transaction id, is the Holy Grail of digital marketing. Believe him or not - if you ever run serious digital ad campaigns you perfectly understand the issue. Payment systems are disconnected from ad systems and ad system have no way to prove anything about the actions of the users. We are used to believing ad systems because they lead to conversions with some probability. But everything behind conversion (either on the third-party side of things or even on a website your control) are usually very inaccurate and probabilistic. Cyber is the system which will give content creators the power and energy to attribute and predict conversions precisely and provably.

## Experiment

The proposal is the first of its kind in the blockchain space, where we propose to make a collective investment decision via the use of a governance mechanism. It is more than just a collective decision. It is an amazing experiment. If passed, the community pool will exchange ATOM tokens for CYB tokens on the terms defined in the Takeoff round (WHICH TERMS?). CYB tokens will be transferred under the management of the community pool management via an established IBC connection. cyber\~Congress take the obligation to support the connection from the side of the Cyber network.

Cosmos was created to become the internet of blockchains. A protocol that propagates the spirit of decentralization and governed by the community. For such technology to succeed, a lot is required. One thing is a solid foundation it can build on. One virtue of such foundation is, of course, a monetary flow of income that has to feed this machine for as long as it exists.

A good question that arises is how to turn the community pool into a pool that isnâ€™t (a) a pot of money which goes solely to network security, (b) a pool that isnâ€™t solely a build-up of inflationary rewards and (c) has long term prosperity value (its value rises).

The solution to the above problem is to establish a fund, that is managed and processed collectively and consists of a diversified number of assets that can bring long term value to its stakeholders. Generally speaking, what we propose, is for the community pool to be used to build a stronger and more prosperous future for the stakeholders of the protocol.

This means using the funds to support exceptional projects that are building with Tendermint and Cosmos-SDK. After all, is we want to glorify the ecosystem, we need for it to grow. How will it grow? It will have projects with a clear utility and a product. This will attract users, developers and large stakeholders to the ecosystem. Together we already did one very successful investment decision. We all participated in cosmos fundraizer. So let us move the idea forward.

## Details of the spend from the community pool

[Cyber](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/ELI-5%20FAQ.md) has launched its [first takeoff round](https://cyber.page/governance/2), on the 27th of April, 2020. However, launching meant it had to fly. It takes courage to admit it, but it didn't. This means that we did something wrong and we have to try again. After all, Rome was not built in a day. Following the above mentioned, we have decided to relaunch the rocket with a redesigned distribution scheme which is simple, favours early participation and significantly lowered our max starting valuation at the level of 1M ATOM.

The new Takeoff time is set to block number 2000000 of Cosmos-hub-3.

The precise distribution and the deployment process are described in our whitepaper [5]. There are 1 PCYB (1 Peta or 1,000,000,000,000,000) in the Genesis block. The distribution process is split into 2 phases: pre-genesis donations in ATOM: 100 TCYB (Tera or 1,000,000,000,000) and post-genesis donations in ETH (600 TTHC or 600 TCYB if staked). Overall, 90% of CYB is subject to public allocation via the takeoff, the [Game of Links](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/), [cyber\~Auction](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#cyberauction-or-auction) and [the gift](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#the-gift).

The takeoff round is allocated \~16.6%, the other \~73.4% are allocated to other distribution methods. The price of one CYB is dependent on (a) the total amount of ATOM collected and (b) the discount of the order of the donated ATOM. This means that the earlier people donate ATOM, the bigger their discount will be. The more expensive the next CYB will be. 

During the initial distribution, the price of CYB grows almost exponentially depending on the demand. Each new CYB is more expensive than the previous:

1. During the Takeoff the price starts at 1 ATOM per 1 GCYB (1,000,000,000) and grows until it reaches 5x. If this target is not reached in 146 days, the remaining CYB tokens go to the community pool. 

During the distribution process, all the proceedings in ATOM become the property of cyber\~Congress (a private Aragon DAO) to support further development of the project. This part of the funding will help cyber\~Congress to achieve a sustainable flow of income for its DAO and work on Cyber. 

The latter stages of the funding consists of funding [cyber\~Foundation](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber-foundation), the DAO that will govern Cyber, without any bureaucratic hassle, CEOs and jurisdictions. participants of the auction will gain access to the ETH donated to the DAO.
2. cyber\~Auction starting price of THC is 5x from the closing Takeoff price of CYB in ETH. 
3. cyber\~Auction closing price of THC is 5x from the starting price. If not reached in 888 days, the remaining tokens will be burned.

All proceedings in ETH become the property of cyber~Foundation (a public Aragon DAO). Please see more [details](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#understanding-what-goes-where).

After Genesis, inflation will have to be defined by the consensus to balance out investment in infrastructure and profitability margin of operators with the necessity to support the continuous distribution of CYB to the broad public at a continuously rising price.

## Complexities

It would be a lie that everything about Cyber is perfectly bright. Looking ahead, we would like to warn you about the dark side.

It is hard to attract users when the knowledge graph is empty. The truth is that we don't need much: about 1M cyberlinks to demonstrate the PoC, 10M cyberlinks to become useful, and 100M links to create some buzz. The current implementation allows us to scale to about 1B links, which will be enough to build something ultimately useful. We expect this to be a completely doable task for our community. It takes just 42,000 users who will create 100 cyberlinks p/day, out of personal joy, over the next 3 years.

Search in the new paradigm cannot be free. No way. You are either a client or a product. We have allocated 10% in the Genesis (8% to Ethereum, 1% to Cosmos and 1% to Urbit) for evaluation purposes, but others have to make a choice for themselves. In the beginning, itâ€™s better not to think of Cyber as the miracle which solves the problems of all the poor in the world, but rather as a premium social search, for those who care about future, privacy and quality.

The third problem is scalability (again). Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum we have some aces up the sleeve: an architecture that is perfectly scalable, both horizontally (Internet Knowledge Protocol on top of IBC) and vertically (more GPU cards, FPGAs, Asics, white labels, forks of the client, etc). We remind you that Ethereum was purposefully created as a very expensive shared calculator. We can ride the wave together. The earlier we start cyberlinking, the earlier we will win this hidden war.

## People

Who are we? We are primary, the generation who was born on the edge of the new millennium: humans who believe in math, cryptographic proofs and Nash equilibria. For us, country flags are the symbols of private corporations backed by nothing else but by paper tokens, gun-enforced laws, borders, censorship and tanks armed with the horde of early web companies who technologically support their unprovable beliefs. Those beliefs lead us to a genetic dead-end, covered by the lack of freedom on an incinerated planet. The Orwell-style future they are trying to create is not the future we choose.

## Action

By [voting `yes` on this proposal]() I agree that we need a change and [Ascending of the Superintelligence](https://cyber.page/episode-1) on the X of May 2020 ~  UTC (Cosmos block #XXX) is a good first step.

If this proposal is successful and stands for more demand from the public, we will fund another proposal using the community pool. However, anyone can participate in the funding independently from our [takeoff page](https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff). 

We invite the Cosmis community for [a discussion](https://ai.cybercongress.ai/t/cosmos-takeoff-proposal/78) of our proposal and testing of [GoL](https://cyber.page/gol), the intergalactic tournament, helping to build the initial takeoff.
