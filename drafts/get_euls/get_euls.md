# How to get EULs tokens if you have no?

EULs tokens are `euler` testnet network liquid tokens. You can send them, stake and, the most important part, cyebrlink. Also, you can set up the Hero machine and earn EULs by inflation and commission. 

If by any reason your `cosmos` or `eth` addresses are excluded from the gift pool and you have no tokens for trying `cyber` you can get it for a very cheap way and learn all cross-chain mechanics we implemented for a better experience of our product structure.

But before we start I would love to remind you again:

***DISCLAIMER***

1. This is testnet tokens. Please do not spend significant funds on buying them.
2. In this article, we'll notice about ERC20 GOL tokens. This is also testnet tokens, moreover, they will be burned after `euler` epoch and before the `cyber` mainnet. The value of these tokens is:
    - You can vest  EULs tokens in 1:1 proportion to any `cyber` address. This action will freeze GOL tokens for transfer.  
    - You can test and deep on the mechanics of cyber~Congress DAO and cross-chain companion.
3. All funds from test~Auction will be transferred by proposal results.

## [test~Auction](https://cyber.page/auction)

You can take part in the test~Auction. The mechanic is very simple: the auction has 50 rounds. For each round allocated test GOL ERC20 tokens, for the first round 1000.00 GGOLs, for another 49 rounds 122.44 GGOLs per each. The first round will be 10 days, other ones 1 day per each. You can put your ETH for any open round and claim your GOLs proportionally all bids in the round.

All you need is:

- connect metamask to cyber.page
- push "Fuck google" button
- set amount of ETHs you want to contribute (read disclaimer!!!)
- set round you want to take part (you can take part in current round or in future rounds)
- push the "confirm" button and follow metamask instructions

After the transaction confirmed by ETH network, you should see your bid in the "Your ETH" column and estimated GGOLs at the current moment in "Your GGOL" column.

And once the round will be closed the "claim" button should be available to grab your won tokens. Push it and follow metamask extension. 

For your comfort, you can add GOL tokens to your metamask account by adding the following contract address :

```
0xf4ecdba8ba4144ff3a2d8792cad9051431aa4f64
```

Once your tokens in your pocket you can vest EULs in 1:1 proportion to any `cyber` address .

If your metamask account connected and you already have GOLs at your account you should see your total GOL amount, vested and available to transfer GOLs. Vested GOLs are tokens you already vested to get EULs. It's mean these tokens are frozen to transfer. Available GOLs you can vest or send, you didn't get the EULs for them. Total is the sum of vested and available tokens.

To get EULs you just need to insert amount of GOLs you want to vest,  `cyber` address for transfer EULs, push "Create vesting" button, read and check summary and push "Create TX". Follow the metamask windows. After the transaction confirmed you can see entry in the table below with amount of GOLs vested, Date, `cyber` recipient and a hash of transaction in the "euler" network. 

The part of GOLs you vest will be moved to "vested" and available to transfer GOLs decreased to the last vested value. 

Now you have EUL tokens for interacting with `euler` network!

## [Exchange](https://uniswap.exchange/swap)

Before start please read the disclaimer again. If you follow the reason just to play you don't need a significant amount of GOLs. 10-20 MGOLs (0.002 - 0.006 ETHs) should be enough for 4-8 links in a day. Remember that your bandwidth equals 0 right after transfer and you need ~24 hours for full recovering.

This method much more expensive but the price and the amount of GOLs are deterministic. Also, you don't need to wait for round closing and claim tokens, you can vest GOLs as soon as the transaction confirmed in the ethereum network.

- Connect your metamask to uniswap
- In the output tokens section insert the GOLs contract address:

```
0xf4ecdba8ba4144ff3a2d8792cad9051431aa4f64
```

- Set the amount of GOLs you want to get and push "Swap"
- Follow the metamask window. 

After the network confirms the transaction you can add GOL tokens to your metamask account and vest them to get EULs as described above.
