### TL;DR
This Community-spend proposal is submitted by the cyber\~Congress DAO. It is the culmination, of over 3 years of hard work, of one small team, on the path to unravelling the entangled web, that has emerged over the last 30 years of the existence of our civilization. The survival of which depends on achieving [censor-free and accessible knowledge](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#the-manifest).

We propose to spend 10,000 ATOMs from the community pool. Passing this proposal will immediately transfer 10,000 ATOMs from the community pool to this multisig address, which is controlled by the cyber\~Congress DAO: ADDRESS. 

The proposal is the first of its kind in the blockchain space, where we propose to make a collective investment decision via the use of a governance mechanism. If passed, the community pool will exchange ATOM tokens for CYB tokens via a future IBC connection. 

### The current problem and the solution (why this proposal)
Cosmos was created to become the internet of blockchains. A protocol that propagates the spirit of decentralization and governed by the community. For such technology to succeed, a lot is required. One thing is a solid foundation it can build on. One virtue of such foundation is, of course, a monetary flow of income that has to feed this machine for as long as it exists.

A good question that arises is how to turn the community pool into a pool that isn’t (a) a pot of money which goes solely to network security, (b) a pool that isn’t solely a build-up of inflationary rewards and (c) has long term prosperity value (its value rises).

The solution to the above problem is to create a fund, that is managed and processed collectively and consists of a diversified number of assets that can bring long term value to its stakeholders. Generally speaking, what we propose, is for the community pool to be used to build a stronger and more prosperous future for the stakeholders of the protocol. 

This means using the funds to support projects that are building with Tendermint and Cosmos-SDK. After all, is we want to glorify the ecosystem, we need for it to grow. How will it grow? It will have projects with a clear utility and a product. This will attract users, developers and large stakeholders to the ecosystem.  

### Detail of the proposal
[Cyber](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/ELI-5%20FAQ.md) which has been developing for over 40 months, has launched its [first takeoff round](https://cyber.page/governance/2), on the 27th of April, 2020. However, launching meant it had to fly. It takes courage to admit it, but it didn't. This means that we did something wrong and we have to try again. After all, Rome was not built in a day. 

Following the above mentioned, we have decided to relaunch the round with a new, lowered, valuation that is more suitable for the current market. Our current valuation for the takeoff round is 300,000 ATOMs, out of which, we propose to fund 10,000, using the Cosmos community pool. 

In exchange for this, the community pool will receive a proportionate amount of Cybers mainnet tokens, CYB. The initial supply of CYB is 1 PCYB, which is 1 with 15 zeroes (or 1 quadrillion).  Overall, 90% of CYB is subject for public allocation via several instruments, including 10%, which were gifted, out of which 1% to the Cosmos community. 

The takeoff round is allocated 16.6%, the other ~73.4% are allocated to other distribution methods: the [Game of Links](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/), [cyber\~Acution](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#cyberauction-or-auction) and [the gift](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#the-gift). The price of one CYB is dependent on (a) the total amount of ATOM collected and (b) the discount of the order of the donated ATOM. This means that the earlier people donate ATOM, the bigger their discount will be. The starting price of 1 GCYB (1,000,000,000 CYB) was ~4.2 ETH during the beginning of the first takeoff. This price will rise with more ATOMs donated.

The takeoff round will last for 146 days and the donated ATOMs will be disposed to the [cyber\-Congress](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#the-cybercongress-dao-and-its-role) DAO to reach a sustainable flow of income and carry on the funding of Cyber. The next step of the funding is an 888-day auction, which will see the funding of our own community governing DAO: [cyber\~Foundation](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber-foundation). This DAO will fund and manage the protocol, without any bureaucratic hassle, or CEO's, as a collective mind. 

If this proposal is successful and stands for more demand from the public, we will fund another proposal using the community pool. However, anyone can participate in the funding independently from our [takeoff page](https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff).

### Cyber
Cyber is a decentralized google. It is an innovative search protocol that can provide provable answers to questions without an intermediary opinion. Its mission is to create a universal search mechanism to: (a) build an open semantic field of the internet with the help of blockchain technology and cyberlinks, and (b) provide more resistance to web services through decentralization of its infrastructure.

The business model of Cyber is a web of dynamic properties, each affecting another, resembling the working and the economics of a well-developed country. Bearing in mind that this is a distributed computer, Cyber has computation, bandwidth and storage. Each of these is used by all or certain types of user groups to achieve certain targets, like utilizing the protocol or gaining a reward. Each group is incentivized to use the protocol and has its own interests. However, all of these interconnect dynamically to build the bigger picture.

The software we offer is a seed of certainty during very uncertain times. This seed consist of:

- [A protocol spec and the rationale behind it](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPjbx76LycfzSSWMcnni6YVvV3UNhTrYzyPMuiA9UQM3x): will help to implement the idea using any technology
- [go-cyber](https://github.com/cybercongress/go-cyber): our implementation in Go
- [cyber.page](https://cyber.page/): the slick reference interface
- [The mainnet predecessor](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/eulerfoundation) of the cyber~Foundation DAO, which will allow the protocol to be governed by its stakeholders without bureaucratic hassle and be in charge of its own monetary decisions
- [Documentation](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md) and [various side tools](https://github.com/cybercongress) that will help you dive deeper into the rabbit hole

### The value proposition of Cyber
Cyber solves the problem of opening up the centralised semantics field of the internet. It does so by shaping an open and accessible semantics field, created (and managed) by the users. This allows to design a trustless, provable and incentivized method of communication between users who provide content and those searching for it. Effeciltvly removing censorship, blackbox intermediary opinions and opening the possibility for a provable, incentivized and a fairer method for anyone to build and use online tools that are built around semantics.

Cyber can be defined as a smart, distributed computer. It can process, store and compute value in the form of providing answers to questions. At first glance, this might seem like a very primitive utility, suited, maximum, for an innovative browser. But that is far from the case. First of all, it is worth pointing out that Cyber provides useful computations! It is one of the first times in the history of blockchain technology where the computations done by the distributed computer have obvious and useful utility, not just to the end-user, but to the whole world. The forming of relevant and provable answers, that will shape an open semantics field.

An open semantics field lets you shape the internet differently. It allows users with interest in prosperity to receive more by using yesterdays' tools. It can make these instruments fairer, more efficient and more relevant. The basic idea is to create an Intercommunication Knowledge Protocol that can interact with everything that is defined by the user. Cyber can account for a large number of use-cases, like: unified semantics, autonomous robots, programmable semantics, personal assistants, language convergence, universal oracles, proof of location and much more. All of these cases are built on semantics. Even including naive cases like e-commerce, that can flourish fairly on local markets, thanks to a distributed, accessible knowledge graph. Queries can be delivered straight out of your personal browsing application. Answers can provide subjective relevance that is important at the time, at the place, to a particular community and/or projects.

Other cases, like social networks, prediction markets, offline search, etc are also possible but are less global, although can have more reach, based on consumer behaviour. The ability to create a Wikipedia without the censorship and blackbox intermediaries is astonishing. The idea of recreating search at its original vision, where you can search for academic papers, search inside of a social network, interact with your own search results, etc, is astonishing.

Cyber can be used for communication with your own database of knowledge. This means, that you control your data. This opens up a multi-billion dollar market of data selling to individuals, who now choose what to do with their data. Other, more far-fetched cases can exist. For example, if I am a trader that searches and trades, I produce metadata I can interact with locally. It can help me to answer where my trades went wrong (with the help of analysing that data of course). Cyber can create local, subjective oracles of data that can be sold. If we provide cyber with the ability to work with second layer semantics (emotions), it can re-create a local, subjective happiness mechanism. Or count the risk of something happening, based on the local semantics field. Of course, this is all up to the users. Cyber allows deleting the boundary between the content provider, the content receiver, the service provider and the service receiver.

### People
Who are we? We are primary, the generation who was born on the edge of the new millennium: humans who believe in math, cryptographic proofs and Nash equilibria. For us, country flags are the symbols of private corporations backed by nothing else but by paper tokens, gun-enforced laws, borders, censorship and tanks armed with the horde of early web companies who technologically support their unprovable beliefs. Those beliefs lead us to a genetic dead-end, covered by the lack of freedom on an incinerated planet. The Orwell-style future they are trying to create is not the future we choose.

### Action
By voting `yes` on this proposal I agree that we need a change and [Ascending off the Superintelligence](https://cyber.page/episode-1) on the 20 of May 2020 ~ 18.00 pm UTC (Cosmos block 2000000).
