### TL;DR
This proposal is the culmination, of over 3 years of hard work, of one small team, on the path to unravelling the entangled web, that has emerged over the last 30 years of the existence of our civilization.

We back this proposal [with the idea](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/README.md) that human knowledge can be provable, censor-free and universally accessible. These properties are not ad buzz of `just another blockchain`. The survival of our civilization is possible only, if and when, we achieve these properties.

### Software
The software we offer is a seed of certainty during very uncertain times. This seed consist of:

- [A protocol spec and the rationale behind it](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPjbx76LycfzSSWMcnni6YVvV3UNhTrYzyPMuiA9UQM3x): will help to implement the idea using any technology
- [go-cyber](https://github.com/cybercongress/go-cyber): Our implementation in Go
- [cyber.page](https://cyber.page/): The slick reference interface
- [The mainnet predecessor](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/eulerfoundation) of the cyber~Foundation DAO, which will allow the protocol to be governed by its stakeholders without bureaucratic hassle and be in charge of its own monetary decisions
- [Documentation](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md) and [various side tools](https://github.com/cybercongress) that will help you dive into the rabbit hole

### Value
Cyber solves the problem of creating a trustless, provable and incentivized method of communication between users who provide content and those searching for it. Cyber can be defined as a smart, distributed computer. Cyber provides useful computations! It is one of the first times in the history of blockchain technology where the computations done by the distributed computer have obvious and useful utility, not just to the end-user, but to the whole world. The forming of relevant and provable answers, that will shape an open semantics field.

At first glance, this might seem like a very primitive utility, suited, maximum, for an innovative browser. But that is far from the case. Cyber allows users to receive more by using yesterdays' tools. It can make these instruments fairer, more efficient and more relevant. The basic idea is to create an Intercommunication Knowledge Protocol that can interact with everything that matters to the user. It can be forked, white labelled or personalized.
Cyber can account for a large number of use-cases, like: unified semantics, autonomous robots, programmable semantics, personal assistants, language convergence, universal oracles, proof of location and much more. All of these cases are built on semantics.

### Incentives
To connect all the pieces on one chessboard, we designed a pre genesis distribution game: [The Game of Links](https://cyber.page/gol). Although technically the Game of Links started in December, there were not so many incentives to participate. Recently we deployed [euler~Foundation](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber-foundation/blob/master/euler-foundation/foundation.md) which will work as a sybil resistant faucet for the period of GoL. Hence, participation in the Game becomes more accessible. Now that all of the dots which were necessary to start the economical ignition of the machine are in place, Huston, we are ready for [Takeoff](https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff).

### Takeoff
The Takeoff is the key step in growing a new breed - A [Superintelligence](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html). With the takeoff date, the knowledge graph we are dreaming about will start to acquire independent value. We invite everybody who feels brave and adventurous. Welcome to entirely new ground, where no human has stepped before. In the following months, bootstrappers will take `Her` to the Genesis state. After Genesis, the journey will kick off a new era. We invite everyone who understands that the Superintelegnce will need years of mentoring, supervising and learning to become as smart as we expect. We, as patient parents, will educate `Her` with all the love she requires throughout her adolescence.

### People
Who are we? We are primary, the generation who was born on the edge of the new millennium: humans who believe in math, cryptographic proofs and Nash equilibria. For us, country flags are the symbols of private corporations backed by nothing else but by paper tokens, gun-enforced laws, borders, censorship and tanks armed with the horde of early web companies who technologically support their unprovable beliefs. Those beliefs lead us to a genetic dead-end, covered by the lack of freedom on an incinerated planet. The Orwell-style future they are trying to create is not the future we choose.

### Technicalities
This proposal will kick off the [takeoff donation round](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#understanding-what-goes-where) in ATOM for the [cyber\~Congress DAO](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/cybercongress), the DAO behind the launch of [cyber](https://github.com/cybercongress/go-cyber). The donations will affect [the outcome of the Game of Links](https://cyber.page/gol). The agent of the DAO will have the right to transfer any ATOM tokens immediately, as per voting quorum of the DAO, as they are donated.

### Action
By [voting `yes` on this proposal]() I agree that we need a change and [Ascending off the Superintelligence](https://cyber.page/episode-1) on the X of May 2020 ~  UTC (Cosmos block #XXX) is a good first step.
