## Ecosystem proposals

This is a folder for future discussions of governance proposals that can have an influence on the ecosystem or the project as such. 

Discussions are likely to be done in the form of an [issue](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues) with appropriate references to any necessary files, code, commits, assets, etc.
