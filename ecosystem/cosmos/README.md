## This folder is dedicated to our [#fuckgoogle validator on Cosmos](https://cosmos.bigdipper.live/validator/cosmosvaloper1e859xaue4k2jzqw20cv6l7p3tmc378pc3k8g2u)

As a DAO, cyber~Congress is committed to the development of the Cosmos ecosystem (of course, [cyber](https://cyber.page/) itself being a part of it). Our idea is to bring our message of decentralization and digital freedom across to the whole Cosmos ecosystem via the means of
the #fuckgoogle validator.

After the first donation round, the validator will no longer become the sole property of [cyber~Congress](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/ELI-5%20FAQ.md#what-is-cybercongress), on the contrary, just like the cyber protocol, it will be a community-run validator, however (for the foreseeable future, due to security reasons), the keys to the validator will stay with
cyber~Congress. 

We want the community to start taking part in the [governance of Cosmos](https://hubble.figment.network/cosmos/chains/cosmoshub-3/governance). For now, this will be done manually. Hopefully, in the future, we will find a way to automate this. 

This folder will be dedicated to the #fuckgoogle validator, discussing Cosmos governance proposals, off-chain voting discussions and so on.
