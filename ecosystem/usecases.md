**CONTAINING PERSONAL OPINION**

## cyber~Usecases

**TL;DR**<br>
There are many ways to describe cyber. In its simplest form, it is a computer for answers. But that leaves a lot of ambiguity as to what this can be used for. In this document, I decided to gather some of the uses cases where we see an implementation for either the protocol itself or any of its (future) components. 

The list will be updated as we go, [contributions](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/pulls), as always, are welcome. Some use cases are down to earth and easily understood, while others require a bit of imagination and some basic understanding of computer science and a certain level of knowledge in communication protocols.

**Usecases**<br>
It is quite difficult to break these by topis as they are all interconnected. Hence, for now, I am not sure how to separate them for easier reading. 

Also, please remember that the below cases are true as of today - partially. Some of them contain my imagination, that requires certain technological implementations.

*Web3 browsers*:
We have [already built one - Cyb](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb). What should be understood, as that Cyb is a personal search application with an inbuilt search engine and another ton of features (like personal robots, the ability to transact, etc). It is your personal app on top of an objective database of knowledge, without any custodial restrictions or any adverts (unless you want to implement them for yourself). What's more important, is that it lacks web2 bullshit. And... you can make your own browser/s on top of Cyber if you have the skills (you can also customize Cyb).

*Personal robots*:
When you start up Cyb, the protocol creates a robot tied to your private key. He is your personal demiurge. He studies with you, helps you, guides you. But he is much more. And he does not have to be alone. In theory, such robots can be taught anything you want them to know. For example: he can be taught semantics related to your trading over the years, follow your trades, study the related papers that you read. This will create a unique trading robot, just yours and only yours. Just imagine what else can a robot be used for if it has access to your knowledge. In theory, with the help of second layer semantics, we can teach robots emotions. I.E. - this cyberlink makes me sad. That cyberlink makes me happy, etc. This allows a robot to give you the content that you want. It allows him to share it, if you want, with others, it allows him to study you - creating things that are way beyond imagination right now. 

*Personal assistant*:
It is not simply a robot, it is an assistant that with the help of certain instruments can help you to evolve, predict your behaviour (let's assume that you allow it to study DNA) and help to teach children, help them to evolve, etc. This is not "I know kong-fu" in 2 seconds, but its the right path in that direction.

*Database access*:
Cyber gives you the ability to access your database of knowledge. Theoretically, create a personal knowledge graph and query it. This means no more losing information. Less time to study a subject. And so on.

*Basic income*:
Such a robot can help to solve 2 problems (a) personal data reselling - if you want to sell it, you decide to do so. (b) the above is just one example of how to produce basic income. In theory personal data, trading robots, content robots, oracle mechanism - they all can provide a human with a basic passive income. This solves a world-renowned issue!

*Gamification*:
There are plenty of examples of how this can be introduced and used. One is, of course, an application that allows personal robots to battle one another and earn rewards. 

*Education*:
Cyber can easily become the main, unbiased and uncontrolled resource for **relevant** information. This is important. Information is dynamic. It evolves. Meaning that a person will have access to relevant information without any intermediary opinions. 

*Programmable (or natural) semantics*:
With the help of Cyber, you can structure search results and target specific semantics cores and index apps as you wish if you were a programmer. If you are a user though, Cyber gives us the ability to literally, re-create the semantics of the web. We communicate with the help of semantics, hence, such communications have been evolving unnaturally due to restrictions and limitations from search engines. considering that search engines contain all that we know as humans, then this is not ok. Cyber lets users and engineers fix this. 

*Create a complicated matrix*:
Google is a genius instrument. Google has all the people on earth working for free and creating a semantically structured centralised database. One of the major issues is that Google does this without using the resources at your disposal (let alone the centralised database and working for free). This means that the semantic matrix that we can create has a restriction. By using all the resources in your possession we can create complicated semantical matrixes around us, helping us to study, evolve and understand things.

*Earn reards*:
As simple as this sounds. It is. Simply cyberlink what is important to you and earn rewards by staking. 

*Intercommunication knowledge graphs*:
All species on earth can have a separate knowledge graph. Any species can intake and output an electromagnetic impulse - hence communicate, therefore - it is intelligent. Meaning that we might not be able to talk directly about our day with other species. But, all species can understand basic behaviour mechanisms - survival, breed, fighting, etc. This means that if each species will have an own knowledge graph, then with the help of second layer semantics and some basic ML algorithms we can create inter-species communications...

*Search actions*: 
It is important to have applications that can transact and can prove those transactions. Cyber allows for several crypto-related powers to emerge. Such as: with the help of wrappers, be able to view balances, send transactions, sign messages, etc. Basically, manage your portfolio if you have the right tools in place. With the help of basic algorithms, the ability to search and analyze blockchains and tangles will allow for many possibilities to study protocols, study behaviour, transactions, and so on. This can help protocols to study and understand computation, resources wastage, bandwidth problems and so on. In theory, Cyber can allow for cross-chain, semantically-backed transactions sometime in the future. This idea is mind-blowing. 

*Off-line search*: 
IPFS makes it possible to easily retrieve a document from such an environment without a global internet connection. cyberd itself can be distributed by using IPFS. This creates the possibility for ubiquitous, off-line search! 

*Command tools*: 
Command-line tools can rely on relevant and structured answers from a search engine. Searching from within CLI tools will inevitably create a highly competitive market of a dedicated semantic core for robots.

*Autonomous robots*: 
Cyber offers a minimalistic, but a continuously self-improving data source, which provides the necessary tools for programming economically rational robots. With the help of IoT integrations and basic networking tools, we can create robots that make decisions based upon a well studied and structured semantic database (knowledge graph).

*Language convergence*: 
A dream of a truly global language is hard to deploy because it is hard to agree on what means what. However, we have the tools to make this dream come true. A programmer should not care about what language will an agent be using. The entire UTF-8 spectrum is at work. The semantic core is open, so competition for answering queries can become distributed across different domain-specific areas, including the semantic cores for various languages. 

*Self prediction and risk management*:
Cyber can analyze its state based on a huge internal knowledge database that is constantly evolving. What's more interesting is that a consensus computer can continuously build a knowledge graph on its own, predicting the existence of cyberlinks and applying these predictions to its state. This means that we can create rather crazy things, for example: risk management instruments, war predictions, economic failure or success predictions, etc. 

*Universal oracle*: 
A consensus computer can store the most relevant data in a key-value storage, where the key is a CID and the values are the bytes of the actual content. To compute utility measure, validators check the availability and the size of the content for the top-ranked content addresses within the knowledge graph, then, weight on the size of the CIDs and its rank. Values could be used in programs. If we try to imagine what this can lead to, then we can come up with the unimaginable. One such example can be a local or a universal program that can be used to reach local consensus for something that could not have been reached before. This is based on the fact that the analysis happens on data, that is based on the true will of the agents. 

*Universal emotional mechanism*:
In theory, combined with your personal robot that has been semantically thought emotions, we have the option to speak to our mind. We can analyze all the data that we been studying for years and query it. For example, an agent was linking for many years, something with the emotion of happiness. By such, this agent can query all the happiness results and then a local community can follow and do the same (each one for himself). Thereafter a local (or on a larger scale) community can choose to share those results between each other and analyze what can be implemented as a suited, organic and a natural happiness mechanism for this particular community, etc.

*Proof of location*:
It is possible to construct cyberlinks with 'proof-of-location', consequently, a location-based search can also become provable, if web3-agents will mine triangulations and attach ‘proof of location’ for every linked chain. Apart from the obvious, this can create digital registers, digital land tokens and even digital countries within geo-space. 

*Proof of web3-agent*: 
Content can be tied with an agent via a private key if that content is on the knowledge graph. This can help to create meaningful air-drops and help for wealth distribution via the use of provable links.

*Natural anthropology*:
If Cyber grows, then it will be easy to connect with like-minded people and build communities with them. With the help of semantics and the knowledge graph, it will be enough, to just press "find people like me" button, and without giving away any information - it will.

*Amazing social networks*:
To continue the above thought, if a person does not want to connect physically, just imagine the on-line possibilities this can create. This will allow for naturally created social networks, with like-minded people, based on knowledge, interests and so on. A network where you talk to people that you want. Maybe in VR. Maybe on a digital piece of land. Without revealing who you are, if you don't want to. Peers will still be able to prove relevance to one another! 

*Motivation for read requests*:
It would be great to create cybernomics not only for ‘write’ requests to consensus computers but from ‘read’ requests too. Thus, read requests can become orders of magnitude cheaper but still guaranteed. Read requests to a search engine can be provided by the second tier of nodes which earn CYB tokens within state channels. We consider implementing state channels based on HTLC and proof of verification, which unlocks the number of tokens earned for already served requests.

*Prediction markets on link relevance and beyond*:
An application that allows betting on link relevance can become a unique source of truth for the direction of terms. This can create a whole new prediction market. And not only for links but for anything semantically related. Why prediction markets? Because they are (currently) the perfect example of a peer to peer transactional behaviour, meaning that a variety of such markets can help local economies to evolve.

*File-hosting*
File hosting is a huge market. Memory, in terms of disk space, is something we all possess. Several projects in the space are working on solving the issue. We believe that a ranking mechanism can improve search over disk space by a mile. For example, it can introduce more security in terms of seeing which content is ranked higher and which nodes are more trustworthy. Along with our other ideas, like Karma points (for linking) and Urbit integration into the project, it is safe to say that cyber can become a major player on the file-hosting market.
