# The ELI-5 FAQ for Cyber 
This is an attempt at creating an "Explain it like I'm 5" FAQ for Cyber. This is a work in progress, any help will be greatly appreciated.

The biggest help will be submitting more questions, that you think are left unanswered, to this FAQ via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues). If you don't have a GitHub account or you are not sure how to open an issue, simply tag @sereajndmyself in our [TG channel](https://t.me/fuckgoogle), and leave the question there!

You may skim through questions separately, of course, but I advise you to "buckle up your seat belt" and read it all.

### What is a FAQ?
A FAQ is a list of frequently asked question that tries to gather as much as possible information about the project in one place. The purpose of this is to answer questions as simple as possible to give the reader a basic overview of a specific subject, and if necessary refer the reader to more detailed information. 

### What is cyber?
The explanation below is NOT going to be simple, so please do not be put off by it. All the terminology that is used in the first explanation WILL be explained in detail later on in this document. Let me assure you, that if you keep on reading, you will be able to understand Cyber with almost zero previous knowledge. 

Cyber is essentially creating a brand new protocol (a procedure that helps computers to do things in a certain way) for adding and searching information onto a knowledge graph (a compilation of facts about something that provides meaning to the user). And rank this information.

Different types of users create links between 2 IPFS hashes (keep on reading to see what this is) and place them on a knowledge graph by spending bandwidth (amount of data that can be transmitted over a fixed period of time). 

That content is then dynamically ranked with the help of digital tokens and the current parameters of the networks load. This makes the rank dynamic (characterized by continuous change, activity, or progress).

All this is computed (determined with the help of a computer) by validators (a program or a computer that are responsible for checking the validity of something). The validators do so, by using their GPU's (literally - graphics cards). 

This allows to search data on the web, rank it, query it (look it up) and create knowledge databases without BlackBox intermediaries (third parties that try to censor data, hide or push specific results to obtain money, track your data, etc). 

The interesting thing is that such a simple mechanism allows creating a lot of powerful tools as a result. We will go in-detail further down the document into those. For example: unified semantics, SEO instruments, autonomous robots, and a lot more.

### What cyber is NOT?
Cyber is not a commercial product. In fact, it is not a product as such. It is an instrument if you wish, or a tool, that anyone can use. That said, cyber allows for several ways for its participants to earn rewards.

Cyber is not THE new internet. It is a tool that can help to shape and to decentralise (distribute the power of authority) the new coming internet. 

### What problem are you trying to solve?
We are trying to solve the problem of data centralization and data censorship. Which in other words, is decentralization of common knowledge (assuming that data is the new knowledge and that we are moving into the digital age). 

### Why are you doing this?
We believe that each person should be able to control their own data, their identity, their knowledge. We believe that the universe can become a better place if our children live in a digital environment where they are in charge of their actions.

### What's wrong with Google?
Google is a brilliant idea. We do not deny this. But Google is the rebel that has overthrown the dictator and became the dictator itself. Google uses you to shape the essence and the fundamentals of communications between everyone and everything. Whilst at it, Google doesn't care for anyone and will make money on your action and your behalf.

It should be noted, that by this question I am attempting not just at Google, but at all the mega-digital corporations. Feel free to check out what this can lead to in the shape of [Cambridge Analityca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica). If this case is too much to take in or too "loud" for you, feel free to watch some episodes of Black Mirror to see how digital control can "break" society.

### Why now?
Because we are almost done with post-industrialism. We are slowly and surely moving into the digital realm. One can deny or accept this. Now is the time to either have the tools that will help us to shape the matrix the way we want to shape it or give those powers away to someone to control all aspects of our lives.

### Aren't there other, more important problems to solve?
There probably are. But we decided to focus on this because we believe that we understand how to achieve the required result. There are probably more problems and questions to be solved (like hunger, wars, ecology, etc). We believe that our tool can help to play a role in solving if not all, but some of these.

### Aren't there other things out there that solve all of this?
We believe that there is a lot of awesome, open-source technology on the market that can commit to making a change in the world. In fact, most of the technology we use is not something we invented (although the code itself is written from scratch!). They are technologies that have existed previously and are awesome at doing what they do. Our product is a combination of existing technologies, protocols and our own work that has arisen from this. It is specifically targeted at fixing what we think is broken.

### What are distributed technologies?
Distributed technologies are technologies that do not have a central source of power in terms of computing. In terms of blockchains (distributed data ledgers), it is primarily referred to databases that are shared across multiple independent sources and have an agreement on the shared information at any point in time in those databases (are in consensus).

### What is a blockchain
A blockchain is a distributed ledger into which independent participants write, and read from it information. It is protected by the fact that it is distributed across participants computers, which are in agreement one with another at any point of a given time (past or present). A blockchain is auditable to anyone and transparent. This allows its participants to make sure that there is nothing shady happening in the background.

### What is web3?
Web3 is the next evolutionary step in the development of the web. A step that takes away from centralisation of search and social services and away from things that are depended on a single functioning unit (have a central source of authority). It is a step that desires to see involved counterparties and applications communicate directly one with another. In agreement with each other, whilst also, be motivated for this behaviour. And as a result, achieve a safer routing of data and packets (information exchange) on the web. 

### What is IPFS?
IPFS is a peer-to-peer (directly connected between two users) protocol, that is designed to make the web faster, safer, and more open. IPFS makes it possible to spread across high volumes of data and keeps every version of your files. IPFS makes it simple to set up networks for mirroring data. This means that data is pretty much immutable or if you may - everlasting. 

IPFS helps to further distribute the web amongst peers (users). It enables constant availability â€” with or without internet connectivity. You can share and view files, manage large chunks of data, build applications, etc. 

### What's a hash?
A hash means a reworking of old and familiar material. In computing, this refers to a bunch of symbols that represent a particular piece of information/data/file. I.E a sha256 hash of cyber is `99100ac04db2147ef246377b1ea4fc0c17106d37286e5d61cc02201301a85bbb` 

### What is a Merkle tree?
A Merkle tree is the name of a representation (an analogy if you may) of how some data (information) is structured (into a database). It is shaped like a tree, where there is one major root, from which others spawn and they are related to it. From those more branches/roots spawn out, until we get to the leaves, which represent the current upper level of the information. All the information can be traced from any point to any other point and is mathematically tied one to another.

### What is a consensus computer?
A consensus in computing refers to the process of different computers coming to an agreement on some data and/or its value. For example, they might need to agree on the current time or whether or not Alice has 10 BTC (Bitcoins) on her account balance. So, a consensus computer is a computer that is involved in that process (usually used specifacllay and solely for that purpose). 

### What are knowledge graphs?
Knowledge graphs are a compilation of facts and information that provide meaning to a specific search result. I.E. if you search for Bitcoin, you might see a box on the side of the search results with lots of data about Bitcoin, what it is, where to get some, etc. This is essentially, the work of a knowledge graph. Currently, knowledge graphs use data from Wikipedia, Wikidata and other sources (which almost all, belong to Google). 

### What's PageRank?
It is one of the algorithms used by Google to rank search results. At a very basic level, it is based on the principle of counting incoming, quality links. Based on this information it decides what website should be ranked higher.

### What exactly are CIDs?
A CID is a content identificator or an IPFS hash. That means its a something that represents (or rather - points to) a specific file/piece of data within the IPFS protocol.

### What are cyberlinks?
Cyberlink is a link between two CIDs or between 2 IPFS hashes. 

### How is cyberlink different to a hyperlink?
A hyperlink is dependent on central data servers and packet routing. On the other hand, IPFS hashes are immutable (cannot be tampered with after they were created, or - permanent). Meaning that no one can tamper with it, as opposed to hyperlinks (this does not mean that you cannot change a file or modify it, but if you do - the fact that you have dame a change will be known).  

This allows us to make sure that the information in a cyberlink is true. Cyberlinks can also form linkchains of information if they were created by the same user.

### Is linking really that important?
Yes! Hyperlinks shape the internet. They have built it. We base our knowledge, our political, economic and educational decisions on the internet. We learn from Google. Google is our father, teacher, source of knowledge, social life, etc. But, how can we trust the internet if it was shaped by something that itself is untrusted? Well, we can't. Cyberlinks, on the other hand, are trusted and backed by a provable and an auditable mechanism that anyone can check. This means that with the aid of cyberlinks we can, no less, but to create a trusted model of all the information in the universe!

### How is content ranked in cyber?
You might be surprised to learn that our ranking mechanism is based on no other, but the original idea of PageRank! The differences are that our mechanism mixes into the pot economical incentives in the form of digital tokens and bandwidth. This makes it "Sybil-resistant".

### What is Sybil resistance?
Sybil resistant means that it can withstand Sybil attacks. A Sybil attack is simply an attack on a system where the attacker uses a lot of pseudos (fake) identities to gain influence for himself.

### What's a token?
A token in blockchain terms is a digital representation of some certain value, relating to a specific distributed ledger. It should contain some utility i.e. it should be used to do something, which in turn gives it value for the participants (users) of that ledger. It can be represented in a number of ways and there can be more than one token on one ledger. 

### What is a transaction?
In terms of a blockchain, a transaction is the process of moving data. I.E. I have 10 dollars and pass them to your account. I made a transaction.

### How are pages included or excluded from the index?
Pages are added to the index when someone submits a CID or creates a cyberlink. This is a transaction. Transactions are checked by validators (the computers that make sure you have the balance to submit a transaction) and added to the knowledge graph, which is then accessed by someone who queries the database. 

Pages are not excluded from the index in any way. 

### So is there any censorship?
Nope... Not on the protocol level. Not on the database level. Not on the consensus level. Every transaction should and must be routed (passed to its destination whatever it maybe).

### So what do you do with those who break the law?
If we obscure from the question of what is the law and by whom it determines, then:

There are no bad intentions in wanting to find the answer to something. You might not know something is "bad" until you know what it is. We are born Tabula Rasa - a clean sheet. The answer itself might indeed contain information that someone might see as "bad" or "inappropriate". This is not something we can control. We do not produce the information, we provide the tool to search through it and obtain it. 

It can be assumed that in the future, someone will build applications on top of cyber and might want to filter out information on the application level (the results that the end-users sees and interacts with). This is not encouraged but indeed is up to the developer. We will never do something like this. Regarldess if this happens or not, the protocol will NOT be censored and that information will be accessible. 

This will create a competition between developers to pass the truth to the users.

### So who has the power?
No one or rather everyone. Our idea is to design a tool where everyone feels equal. With that said, this can defiantly act like a competitive instrument. Someone who posses more tokens can link content (and hence rank it) with more weight. However, we would like to discourage the thinking that someone has more power than others (continue reading) as the purpose of the tool is to share and access information freely. The amount of tokens in possession does not influence this virtue. 

### So whoever is richer will always stay on top, right?
Someone who ranks content with a higher value will see his content ranked higher. That is obvious. With that, he does not have an indexation preference. Here, the principle: first come - first served, will always function. If you were first to index something, then you indexed it before someone else did. I mean if I ate the last ice cream in the fridge, then I ate the last ice cream in the fridge.

With that, the search is dynamic. The rank of the content is NOT based in that way that older content disappears just because the new content is cooler or Visa-Versa. If I rank a content then it is relevant to me here and now. If I am not interested in it, then I have stopped ranking it. Whatever I stopped ranking will lose rank. But, apart from my weight, the rank depends on the weight of incoming and outgoing ranks. And those ranks depend on their incoming and outgoing ranks... This makes it a never endless game, where simply because I have more tokens, might not be enough for me to always end up on top.

### What's bandwidth?
Bandwidth is the amount of information someone can pass through some resource at a given time frame. For example (which is a mere analogy), if I am able to move 5 stones from room A to room B in the space of one hour. Then we can say that my stone bandwidth is 5 stones per hour. Bandwith in IT relates to information and the ability to pass a certain amount of data from one place to another. 

In cyber bandwidth plays a major role. It is a spam protection mechanism. It allows a user to only do a certain amount of transaction in a certain amount of time. Then, over time, it regenerates to give the user more ability to commit more transactions.

### Why search?
Search is a global mechanism that is globally understood by everyone, regardless of language, race, age, etc. It is somewhat a basic instinct (searching for food to survive, etc). In the digital realm with the help of search, we gain answers to our questions, which we always ask. Search helps us to build a model around any subject that is of interest to us. With the use of search, we can build databases, which can lead to a great number of useful instruments (on these later).

### Who are validators?
The validators are someone or rather a computer. Well, the word validator refers to both. Someone who runs a specific computer and the computer itself. Validators are making sure that all the transactions (communications) carried out in cyber are done correctly (i.e. that users aren't trying to cheat the system). Validators are auditable computers and their work is transparent. They have to reach consensus on the state of the ledger. And in cyber they compute (calculate) the knowledge graph that the users commit links to (they also commit links to the graph). For their work, they receive a reward from the blockchain. Which is automatically calculated by the system. Validators also participate in goverance and can stake tokens to receive rewards. They can also stake delegators tokens and pay rewards out. 

### Who are delegators?
Delegators are usees that delegate their tokens to validators to participate in receiving staking reards. For this validators might charge commission. 

### What is staking?
Staking is the process of "locking" your tokens to receive rewards.

### What is the purpose of staking?
The purpose of staking is network security. The tokens that are locked, the better for the system. This is done to prevent the so-called 51% attack. Which means that someone gains access to 51% of the resources and can then cheat the system in his favour. The rewards are the incentive which users receive for "locking" their tokens to protect the system.
