### Cyber: A decentralized google for provable and relevant answers
Our mission is to create a universal search protocol to (a) build an open semantic field of the internet with the help of blockchain technology and cyberlinks, and (b) decentralize the infrastructure of the web with the help of blockchain

### This is a publicl repository to help coordinate collaboration efforts, create communities and develop cyber
The coordination of efforts include: 
- helping to create a validator pool
- helping to build communities
- connecting teams
- helping R&D 
- cross-promote products and protocols 
- provide strategic grants in the future
- creating and taking part in governance proposals
- VC and partnerships
- creating useful and unique documentation
- working towards a common goal
