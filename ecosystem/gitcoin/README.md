## Gitcoin program: proposals and discussions

We believe in progress. We value contribution. We believe that we need to learn to help one another. This is why we want to develop the Gitcoin program inside of `cyber`. 

A detailed intro and a description on why we do this and how the process is orginesed, [can be found here](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/tree/master/community).

In one sentecne: Every sprint we allocate a certain amount of ETH and distribute it between our teammembers to actively use gitcoin.

The role of cyber~Ecosystem in the Gitcoin program is the following:
- spun dissusions for an awesome future fix / request via issues
- drive open-source development via funding 
- create an awesome community of open-source hackers and researchers

Our [gitcoin issues](https://gitcoin.co/profile/cybercongress) can be found in the previous link. We try to attach good descriptions to them, along with the neccassery user stories. 

We try to answer comments regularly inisde the issues and in our [devChat](https://t.me/fuckgoogle).
