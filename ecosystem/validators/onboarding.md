# This is as an onboarding point for cyber validators

### The mission
Cyber is a decentralized google. Its mission is to create a universal search protocol to (a) build an open semantic field of the internet with the help of blockchain technology and [cyberlinks](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/ELI-5%20FAQ.md#what-are-cyberlinks), and (b) decentralise the infrastructure of search with the help of blockchain.

### The short track
If you don't want to read the whole doc and know what and why you are doing this, simply follow this guide:
- How to run a validator on cyber: [a step by step guide](https://cybercongress.ai/docs/cyberd/run_validator/)

### The long track
If you feel comfortable with setting up validators, familiar with what we do already, but still unsure about cyber, then the below links are for you:
- An A-Z [video instruction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMUatLPfNJM&list=PLOcP3DXQoNUUYQpGYh8cdRKfmXtFLEF0o&index=1) for 
setting up a cyber node and infrastructure
- How to run a validator on cyber: [a step by step guide](https://cybercongress.ai/docs/cyberd/run_validator/)
- The rules to [the Game of Links](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/) (the current incentivized testnet)
- Validators can bootstrap initial fuel [via faucets](https://t.me/InterchainWalletBot), [the Game of Links](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/) and [the gift](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/ELI-5%20FAQ.md)

### For everything else... 
If you don't feel like you're sure about what cyber does, what validators do or if you do, but need some additional info - it's below. Regardless of whether you are a professional validator, a miner or just starting up.
- [What is cyber: the big FAQ](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/ELI-5%20FAQ.md)
- Cyber gifted 10% of it's supply to ETH/ATOM/URBIT, you probably already have some CYB from [the gift](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Gift%20FAQ%20and%20general%20gift%20information.md).
Or just search for [your address here](https://cyber.page/#/search/0x742d35cc6634c0532925a3b844bc454e4438f44e) (just substitute the address for your own)
- You probably want to know the [economic breakdown](https://github.com/cybercongress/launch-kit/blob/0.1.0/README.md#distribution-params)
- If you are still uncertain about the distribution, check out [the White Paper](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmceNpj6HfS81PcCaQXrFMQf7LR5FTLkdG9sbSRNy3UXoZ)
- The tesntet is incentivized. Read about [the Game of Links](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/) and its distribution

### Can you explain all of this in a paragraph?
Cyber is a decentralized google for provable and relevant answers. Due to its simple architecture, cyber can build a predictive model of the universe. Being an intelligent beast, cyber uses economic incentives, blockchain technology, IPFS and semantics to build the new Great Web. Cyber is at the infrastructure stage and it needs heroes that are ready to save the galaxy from extinction. Hence, cyber deployed a public incentivized testnet and is using distribution games to help onboard developers, validators, researchers and users to the Great Web. To get more traction, cyber decided to gift the best projects out there: ETH, ATOM and URBIT. Because cyber is built by geeks it's very geeky but has lots of
awesome features described in the docs above.

### But what about the protocol itself?
- [cyber~Congress](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/ELI-5%20FAQ.md#what-is-cybercongress) is just the launching DAO
- The donated ATOMs will be used for the [#fuckgoogle Cosmos vlaidator](https://www.mintscan.io/validators/cosmosvaloper1e859xaue4k2jzqw20cv6l7p3tmc378pc3k8g2u). The staking rewards, to support the [development](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/README.md) of the protocol from the team 
- The protocol will be governed by the validators and [cyber~Foundation](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/ELI-5%20FAQ.md#what-is-cyberfoundation) (they will be in charge of the ETH bags donated during [cyber~Auction](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/ELI-5%20FAQ.md#what-is-cyberauction))
- After that, the team plans to develop the ecosystem via [cyber~FundClassic](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/ELI-5%20FAQ.md#who-are-cyberfundclassic) 
- Here are some of our [community development plans](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md) (if you are from Earth, read marketing)
- We also [use Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/cybercongress) to onboard open-source devs
- You can already [use the protocol and search](https://cyber.page/#/brain)
- This is just the very tip of the iceberg: there is [cyb](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb), [cyb~Virus](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb-virus), [chaingear](https://github.com/cybercongress/chaingear) and much more
- Here is a [short 5-hour video of our plans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpoKq-fCXhM), we also publish [development reports](https://cybercongress.ai/cyber-reports/)
- What it is it good for...[basic usecases](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/usecases.md)

### Shut up and take my money
If you're ready to dive in deeper, then [set up a hero](https://cybercongress.ai/docs/cyberd/run_validator/), 
[play the game](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/) and read [why we do what we do](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/README.md)
