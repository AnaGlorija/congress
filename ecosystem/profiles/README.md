### A list of our public profiles:

You are welcome to join the discussions. More so, it will be a great help to us if you do!

*A small note:* 
We do not use all of the bellow profiles! We do not believe in silly marketing and bullshit bingo... <br>
The point of this document is to show all our profiles to the public. <br>
Our main channel is and will remain our GitHub, backed by our website and (for now) a public TG channel.
