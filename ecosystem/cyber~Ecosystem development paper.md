## cyber~Ecosystem development paper 

### Abstract
This paper shall propose a view on the development of cyber~Ecosystem, describe what it is, what are its goals, values and participants. 

It is always difficult to create sub-papers, hence, I would like to propose of anyone reading this document, not to view it as such or as something that is a replacement for our [main white paper](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber/blob/master/main.tex). On the contrary, our white paper is and always will remain our main document. This paper, in my opinion, should be viewed as an add-on. An insight into one the realms forming Cyber. 

cyber~Ecosystem is everything that wraps the unwrapped. Its common goal: to build a better and a unique new web - the Great Web. To achieve this it will help to form partnerships, onboard communities, help research, connect people, do VC work when necessary, create and review documentation, participate in the governance, help to validate and build the chain and its applications. First, it will do its work manually, but its goal is to automate as much of the work as possible with the help of the future Aragon DAO and the future abilities of Cyber chain. It will also create cyber ~FundClassic to help onboarding hackers, researchers and users. 

### The forming blocks
What I propose, is to separately describe each of the combining blocks of cyber~Ecosystem in detail and then conclude with a visions statement. 

I will be adding to these blocks and adding more blocks, as time progresses. 

### The workflow
Anyone is welcome to contribute to this work via a PR to this repository. All of the work done within the ecosystem will primarily, be concentrated within this folder, broken further into the [necessary subfolders](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/tree/master/ecosystem).

[Issues](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues) and [PR's](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/pulls) are a way of communicating. 

### Community work 
One of the main goals is to form a community of scientists, geeks, researches, validators, hackers, web3 agents and users as such (of any other possible category) for Cyber. 

This means on and off-line work in the form of creating certain profiles with the necessary communities, forums and chats. Most of the proposed communities to onboard can be found in [this issue](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues/195). I would imagine that sooner or later we will manage to introduce Cyber to all of these communities in a significant manner, so the issue will eventually be closed. But, it will still be viewable for anyone wishing to see what was done, and what is planned for now. 

To further grow our influence within our most important community for now - [the Cosmic commyunity](https://github.com/cosmos), I believe a set-up of a Cosmos validator is required as [per this issue](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues/203). This will allow us to skate ATOM tokens as described in [our paper](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber/blob/master/main.tex), fund our work via grants and not dump any tokens on the market. 

The Cosmos community is and will remain vital to the success of Cyber as it is not only allowing us to create a solid and an experienced validator set-pool but also allows to remain part of one of the most promising crypto-projects within the game, that can connect interplanetary communities and species via [state of the art cryptograhpy](https://cosmos.network/intro). 

Validators can be found within a lot of other communities that have a somewhat similar computing or/and consensus mechanisms to Cyber. Those can be any communities mining using CUDA. Or simply communities that are BFT/POS based. Unfortunately, not all are applicable. Most of the planned work with such communities can be found in [this task](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues/254). 

In the future, a set of community members will be vital for the success of the network and onboarding new and young enthusiasts, scientist and engineers. Hence, we will concentrate on onboarding young generation onto Cyber via the use of the needed tools (those can be social networks, forums, etc). 

To achieve this, our fork-force alone - isn't enough. So, we will create a distributed Ambassador network, that will be funded in CYB tokens from the [ecosystem~Fund](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/teams/incentives.md). Their mission will be to spread the word via hackathons and meetups, for which they will be rewarded out of the fund (postfactum) for their work.

There are several other communities we view as vital: those are (1) [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum) (2) [Urbit](https://github.com/urbit) (3) [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs) (4) Web3 and many more. All of the work with them will be described in the ecosystem folder, as per [this example with Urbit](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/communities/urbit/urbit.md). 

Drops and gifts are part of the proposed onboarding. Other instruments include showcasing our future work, research and values to those communities to find common ground with them. 

Web3 is a very broad term that can onviosuoly include endless amount of projects, (not including the already mentioned Urbit, Cosmos and Ethereum). For now, those are (in no particalur order): (1) [Everpidea](https://github.com/EveripediaNetwork/) (2) [FOAM](https://github.com/f-o-a-m/) (3) [Decentralnad](https://github.com/decentraland) (4) [Steem](https://github.com/steemit/steem) / [Golos](https://github.com/cyberway) communties - not neccaserely in their current implemtations, but we see those communtiies as very vital to helping us index blockahins (5) [Openbazaar](https://github.com/openbazaar) (6) [IOTA](https://github.com/iotaledger) (7) [Melonport](https://github.com/melonproject) (8) [Filecoin](https://github.com/filecoin-project) (9) [Polkadot](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot) (10) [Augur](https://github.com/AugurProject) (11) [Aragon](https://github.com/aragon) (11) [Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/) (12)[MaidSafe](https://github.com/maidsafe).

Please note, that by the above I want to describe a spectre of modern and efficient computers and their communities, rather than the foundations or organizations standing behind those projects. A distributed computer goes a mile further than the foundation behind it. This means onboarding communities and the ideas behind them rather than the corps behind those projects

### Allies and partnerships
To achieve some of the above goals we need to form strategic partnerships. Mind you, we do not expect any of the above projects to jump the train just because we are awesome. More so, as you can see, we believe that developing Cyber means developing computing, rather than developing foundations behind those computers. This means that we will first of all look for similar values with our future allies. 

Those can be [OS like Tails](https://tails.boum.org/) for example or the above mentioned IPFS protocol community. Those could be anyone sharing our views to overthrow megacorps and build a safe, secure and an efficient web for the future. 

The formation of such partnerships is difficult. For one, because it requires to offer something that doesn't exist yet, but has to be formed out of values and future technology. Hence, for now, I will just leave this at that.

### Governance, proposals and hacking
As described in our paper the donated funds from ETH, will be governed by an Aragon DAO. This means community governance for pretty much everything. Building applications, developing the protocol, onboarding projects, etc.

We understand that this is a difficult task. Hence one of the tasks will be to help this evolve naturally. The least we can do is to take part in helping to form those proposals and provide the needed tooling to help the community to act on its will via their proposals. 

The ecosystem part will be to help to discuss those proposals and forward them to the required hackers that can build on top of these. One thing I would imagine seeing in the future is the implementation of a similar mechanism to [Holographic coinsesus](https://medium.com/daostack/holographic-consensus-part-1-116a73ba1e1c) within the governance realm. Such a mechanism of prediction markets on proposals can drastically improve attention to governance and participation in it.

Other than this, governance should be community-based, meaning that the ecosystem will be a mere participant just like its other members. But as we are committed to the development of the protocol, we also want to commit to helping shape a governance mechanism, whatever the community decides for it to be. Meaning, the above is simply a vision and by no means a call to action. 

We view developers as a vital part of a functioning mechanism of any technological product. This means that we will be funding [Gitcoin issues](https://gitcoin.co/cybercongress) to help us develop the protocol (and beyond) and help to build a distributed hacker community around Cyber.  

### Research and R&D
All this requires research. A lot of research. Open-source, funded research that will benefit, not just Cyber, but will benefit the world. An example of what I mean [can be found here](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/research/knowledge%20graph/Deep%20Bidirectional%20Transformers%20(working%20name).md), in our first proposal for community research, that will be granted by cyber~Congress. 

We want to prove that our vision of [the Evolution of spicies](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/README.md) can and will uphold. It is vital to the overall success of the protocol. It can prove that all beings and species can communicate. They can control their private keys and can transact, hence communicate their will, which can be further computed onto a knowledge graph - ranked and indexed. Hence, creating truly intergalactic communication. 

We are hoping that scientists all over the world can see that what we propose via Cyber protocol is beneficial to everyone, not just its users. Hence, it will be one of the concentration points of work, forming the ecosystem.

### VC
All this requires funds. As much as we would love for all to simply help us, distribute our tokens and let the beast live - we are aware that we are leaving in a world spun by money, which in itself isn't bad. Money is simply a communication protocol, alas - one that is broken. 

Luckily for us, blockchain helps to fix this. In our paper, we describe the donation process, which I will not go into again. What it does mean, is that one of the main tasks of cyber~Ecosystem is to help to receive those donations from some resources. This means a lot of off-line and on-line community work, described above. 

It means that participation in certain events or the creation of such events will be one of its tasks. It means that promotion to on and off-line media will also be a task. 

We want to be clear about our intentions, this means that we do have personal incentives for this part of the work. Those incentives can be [found here](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/teams/incentives.md).

### cyber~FundClassic
The above-mentioned document also mentions the ecosystem~ Fund. This fund will be funded out of the personal bag of cyber~Congress and its team members that wish to fund it. However, I believe that a further option of having community members also help to fund should remain open.

The purpose of cyber~FundClassic is simple - find teams that want to build on top of the Cyber protocol, fund them, help them to buidl. The idea behind it as simple as they get - [Ycombinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/). This means that the fund can be entitled to receive possible future profits from projects that it funds, and so are its funding members.

### Roadmap
Just like engineering work, community work is a bit ambiguous and can be vague with dates. Hence, I believe that providing concrete dates isn't correct. However, we will provide a roadmap that will be constantly updated - [right here](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/roadmap/README.md).

### Conclusion
cyber~Ecosystem will help to coordinate collaboration efforts, create communities and develop Cyber altogether. It will create cyber ~FundClassic to fund projects that will develop on top of the Cyber protocol. Work on strategic partnerships with allies that share our vision. Fund public and influential research, development, hackers and scientists. It will help to onboard communities, cross-promote products and protocols - to create a unique vision of the coming Great Web.
