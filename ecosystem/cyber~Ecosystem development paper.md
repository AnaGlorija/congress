# cyber~Ecosystem development paper 

## Abstract
This paper shall propose a view on the development of cyber~Ecosystem, describe what it is, its goals, values and participants. It should also offer theoretical and practical metrics that can measure the success of the proposed building blocks that will form the growth of the ecosystem.

It is always difficult to create sub-papers, hence, I would like to propose of anyone reading this document, not to view it as such, or, as something that is a replacement for our [main white paper](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQ1Vong13MDNxixDyUdjniqqEj8sjuNEBYMyhQU4gQgq3). On the contrary, our white paper is and always will remain our main document. This paper, in my opinion, should be viewed as an add-on. An insight into one of the realms forming Cyber. 

cyber~Ecosystem is everything that wraps the unwrapped. Its common goal: to build a better and a unique new web - the Great Web. To achieve this it will help to form partnerships, onboard communities, help research, connect people, do VC work when necessary, create and review documentation, participate in the governance, help to validate and build the chain and its applications. First, it will do its work manually, but its goal is to automate as much of the work as possible with the help of the future Aragon DAO and the future abilities of Cyber chain. It will also create cyber ~FundClassic to help onboarding hackers, researchers and users. 

## Content and document workflow
In this document, I propose to separately describe each of the combining blocks of cyber~ Ecosystem in detail and discuss the possible metrics to measure their usefulness and total growth. Describe the role of cyber~Congress and conclude with a visions statement. 

I will be adding to these blocks and adding more blocks, as time progresses. 

Anyone is welcome to contribute to this work via a PR to this repository. All of the work done within the ecosystem will primarily, be concentrated within this folder, broken further into the [necessary subfolders](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/tree/master/ecosystem).

[Issues](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues) and [PR's](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/pulls) are a way of communicating. 

## The forming blocks of cyber~Ecosystem
#### Community work
One of the main goals is to form a community of scientists, geeks, researches, validators, hackers, web3 agents and users as such (of any other possible category) for Cyber. 

This means on and off-line work in the form of creating certain profiles with the necessary communities, forums and chats. Most of the proposed communities to onboard can be found in [this issue](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues/195). I would imagine that sooner or later we will manage to introduce Cyber to all of these communities in a significant manner, so the issue will eventually be closed. But, it will still be viewable for anyone wishing to see what was done, and what is planned for now. 

To further grow our influence within our most important community for now - [the Cosmic commyunity](https://github.com/cosmos), I believe a set-up of a Cosmos validator is required as [per this issue](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues/203). This will allow us to skate ATOM tokens as described in [our paper](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQ1Vong13MDNxixDyUdjniqqEj8sjuNEBYMyhQU4gQgq3), fund our work via grants and not dump any tokens on the market. 

The Cosmos community is and will remain vital to the success of Cyber as it is not only allowing us to create a solid and an experienced validator set-pool but also allows to remain part of one of the most promising crypto-projects within the game, that can connect interplanetary communities and species via [state of the art cryptograhpy](https://cosmos.network/intro). 

Validators can be found within a lot of other communities that have a somewhat similar computing or/and consensus mechanisms to Cyber. Those can be any communities mining using CUDA. Or simply communities that are BFT/POS based. Unfortunately, not all are applicable. Most of the planned work with such communities can be found in [this task](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues/254). 

In the future, a set of community members will be vital for the success of the network and onboarding new and young enthusiasts, scientist and engineers. Hence, we will concentrate on onboarding young generation onto Cyber via the use of the needed tools (those can be social networks, forums, etc). 

To achieve this, our fork-force alone - isn't enough. So, we will create a distributed Ambassador network, that will be funded in CYB tokens from the [ecosystem~Fund](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/teams/incentives.md). Their mission will be to spread the word via hackathons and meetups, for which they will be rewarded out of the fund (postfactum) for their work.

There are several other communities we view as vital: those are (1) [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum) (2) [Urbit](https://github.com/urbit) (3) [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs) (4) Web3 and many more. All of the work with them will be described in the ecosystem folder, as per [this example with Urbit](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/communities/urbit/urbit.md). 

Drops and gifts are part of the proposed onboarding. Other instruments include showcasing our future work, research and values to those communities to find common ground with them. 

Web3 is a very broad term that can onviosuoly include endless amount of projects, (not including the already mentioned Urbit, Cosmos and Ethereum). For now, those are (in no particalur order): (1) [Everpidea](https://github.com/EveripediaNetwork/) (2) [FOAM](https://github.com/f-o-a-m/) (3) [Decentralnad](https://github.com/decentraland) (4) [Steem](https://github.com/steemit/steem) / [Golos](https://github.com/cyberway) communties - not neccaserely in their current implemtations, but we see those communtiies as very vital to helping us index blockahins (5) [Openbazaar](https://github.com/openbazaar) (6) [IOTA](https://github.com/iotaledger) (7) [Melonport](https://github.com/melonproject) (8) [Filecoin](https://github.com/filecoin-project) (9) [Polkadot](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot) (10) [Augur](https://github.com/AugurProject) (11) [Aragon](https://github.com/aragon) (11) [Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/) (12) [MaidSafe](https://github.com/maidsafe).

Please note, that by the above I want to describe a spectre of modern and efficient computers and their communities, rather than the foundations or organizations standing behind those projects. A distributed computer goes a mile further than the foundation behind it. This means onboarding communities and the ideas behind them rather than the corps behind those projects.

**Metrics and TA:**<br>
*TA*: All types of users | Focus on [#195](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues/195) <br>
*Measure Metrics*: commMetric | Total number of posts about Cyber to measure overall community involvemnt.
As a side metric, the number of links to the WP can also be used.

#### Cyberc0n
Off-line events allow communities to grow stronger. Hackathons and useful conferences can help to build-up new teams together, allow form fabulous new creations. A perfect example of how awesome events shape the world was [DEVCON-0](https://ethereum-homestead.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/history-of-ethereum.html), but we believe we can do much better.

cyber~Congress ha already organised [one self-governing event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfG_mn6psRQ&list=PL-MRS5fkWajCmfAS1WxBVgtMdFPmS4WTZ). To our knowledge, it was the first world conference to be run by a smart contract. We think that this is how it should be. And just as others, we learn our lessons. 

In our plans for the coming year, to organise Cyberc0n-1. It will be a completely sovereign and a self-ruling entity, that humans can help to run. No more boring and long speeches. We plan entirely new formats, with whiteboards, geeks and ~blakc-jack~ coding.

**Metrics and TA:**<br>
*TA*: Event participants <br>
*Measure Metrics*: conMetric | Total number of participants at the event that claimed a gift after the event.

#### Friendly aliens and partenrships
To achieve some of the above goals we need to form strategic partnerships. Mind you, we do not expect any of the above projects to jump the train just because we are awesome. More so, as you can see, we believe that developing Cyber means developing computing, rather than developing foundations behind those computers. This means that we will first of all look for similar values with our future allies. 

Those can be [OS like Tails](https://tails.boum.org/) for example or the above mentioned IPFS protocol community. Those could be anyone sharing our views to overthrow megacorps and build a safe, secure and an efficient web for the future. 

The formation of such partnerships is difficult. For one, because it requires to offer something that doesn't exist yet, but has to be formed out of values and future technology. Hence, for now, I will just leave this at that.

**Metrics and TA:**<br>
*TA*: Projects and users | Focus on newly formed partnerships <br>
*Measure Metrics*: alienMetric | Watch for changes in tx increase after integration to understand the newly brought value. 

#### Governance and proposals
As described in our paper the donated funds from ETH will be governed by an Aragon DAO. This means community governance for pretty much everything. Building applications, developing the protocol, onboarding projects, etc.

We understand that this is a difficult task. Hence one of the tasks will be to help this evolve naturally. The least we can do is to take part in helping to form those proposals and provide the needed tooling to help the community to act on its will via their proposals. 

The ecosystem part will be to help to discuss those proposals and forward them to the required hackers that can build on top of these. One thing I would imagine seeing in the future is the implementation of a similar mechanism to [Holographic coinsesus](https://medium.com/daostack/holographic-consensus-part-1-116a73ba1e1c) within the governance realm. Such a mechanism of prediction markets on proposals can drastically improve attention to governance and participation in it.

Other than this, governance should be community-based, meaning that the ecosystem will be a mere participant just like its other members. But as we are committed to the development of the protocol, we also want to commit to helping shape a governance mechanism, whatever the community decides for it to be. Meaning, the above is simply a vision and by no means a call to action. 

**Metrics and TA**<br>
*TA*: THC hodlers | Users interested in governance. <br>
*Measure Metrics*: govMetric | Amount of locked THC in proposal contracts to meausre user adoption of governance modules. 

#### Hacking and open-source
If there is one thing that we believe in more than all else, it is probably open-source. Hence, we understand the value of building a community of open-source contributors. 

As much as the powers of open-source alone can be compared with magic, it is vital to drive what works - forward. Gitcoin offers just the solution for this. Developers are a vital part of a functioning mechanism of any technological product. We will be funding [Gitcoin issues](https://gitcoin.co/cybercongress) to help us develop the protocol (and beyond) and help us to build a distributed hacker community from all over the world.  

We believe that we need to become part of the Gitcoin community, hence, we will try not just fund our issues, but also attach good descriptions along with the current projects state and user stories.

**Metrics and TA**<br>
*TA*: Gitcoin (and any open-source) committers to Cyber. <br>
*Measure Metrics*: hackMetric | To measure Gitcoin success rate and general technological interest | % of paid funds to % of offered funds for issues | Total number of starred (>2), active forks of Congress repos. 

#### Research and R&D
All this requires research. A lot of research. Open-source, funded research that will benefit, not just Cyber, but will benefit the world. An example of what I mean [can be found here](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/research/knowledge%20graph/Deep%20Bidirectional%20Transformers%20(working%20name).md), in our first proposal for community research, that will be granted by cyber~Congress. 

We want to prove that our vision of [the Evolution of spicies](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/README.md) can and will uphold. It is vital to the overall success of the protocol. It can prove that all beings and species can communicate. They can control their private keys and can transact, hence communicate their will, which can be further computed onto a knowledge graph - ranked and indexed. Hence, creating truly intergalactic communication. 

We are hoping that scientists all over the world can see that what we propose via Cyber protocol is beneficial to everyone, not just its users. Hence, it will be one of the concentration points of work, forming the ecosystem.

**Metrics and TA**<br>
*TA*: Open-source researches and active users. <br>
*Measure Metrics*: researchMetric | Total amount of outside likes/votes on published research to measure its quality. 

#### VC
All this requires funds. As much as we would love for all to simply help us, distribute our tokens and let the beast live - we are aware that we are leaving in a world spun by money, which in itself isn't bad. Money is simply a communication protocol, alas - one that is broken. 

Luckily for us, blockchain helps to fix this. In our paper, we describe the donation process, which I will not go into again. What it does mean, is that one of the main tasks of cyber~Ecosystem is to help to receive those donations from some resources. This means a lot of off-line and on-line community work, described above. 

It means that participation in certain events or the creation of such events will be one of its tasks. It means that promotion to on and off-line media will also be a task. 

We want to be clear about our intentions, this means that we do have personal incentives for this part of the work. Those incentives can be [found here](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/teams/incentives.md).

**Metrics and TA**<br>
*TA*: Doners. <br>
*Measure Metrics*: vcMetric | % of target donations that is closed up to a certain date to understand the success of ongoing donations. 

#### cyber~FundClassic
The above-mentioned document also mentions the ecosystem~ Fund. This fund will be funded out of the personal bag of cyber~Congress and its team members that wish to fund it. However, I believe that a further option of having community members also help to fund should remain open.

The purpose of cyber~FundClassic is simple - find teams that want to build on top of the Cyber protocol, fund them, help them to buidl. The idea behind it as simple as they get - [Ycombinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/). This means that the fund can be entitled to receive possible future profits from projects that it funds, and so are its funding members.

**Metrics and TA**<br>
*TA*: Cyber apps    | Market interest. <br>
*Measure Metrics*: fundMetric | Total cap of tokens issued on top of the Cyber protocol to measure the adoption of the technology and its market value. 

#### The important generation
We have stated on many occasions that we must concentrate on younger generations, not simply because they are the users and the engineers of tomorrow. That is, of course - one reason. But the reality is that the young (and the coming) generation has a completely different recognition of what we do. And that is a good thing.

We can help to build the paradigm that we are fighting for, maybe even live in it. But it is a battle for us to begin with. Starting with the understanding of the flows of the modern financial systems, to the understanding of digital realms, VR, AI and the importance of how search shapes our thinking. For us, a smartphone will always remain somewhat of a mystical creature. Cryptocurrencies will always remain "digital". And everyday use of cryptography (i.e. private keys) will always be a measure of security. And, yes. It is so. But, it is not inbuilt into us. Just like a photo camera is part of our life, so must be cryptos, private keys, the internet and the digital space. So far, we can only grasp the importance of digital space, younger generations can live it. We understand and value this small but vital difference. 

This does not mean we have solely concentrated on onboarding a single type or one type of users. No. This does mean that we will focus our future work around onboarding those peers first.

**Metrics and TA**<br>
*TA*: Young generations of users. <br>
*Measure Metrics*: padawanMetric | % of referencing incoming links from SN to the total amount of incoming links to understand the involvement of younger generations (websites primarily used by younger people). 

## Metrics, measurements and success
**Market fit and value of metrics**<br>
We should be able to measure our success. This will allow us to glue all of the blocks into one chain and will allow contributors to contribute, by seeing the desired case along with a metric for that case.

There are 2 parts I would propose to go about this. One is understanding the market fit and the growth metrics (yes, the ecosystem != marketing, but in today's reality, engineers should contribute to the growth if we want to succeed). And the already above-mentioned metrics to measuring the above blocks of focus.

A project should have (a) a market fit (b) be able to measure retention. A project should also consider that retention measurements should apply to your projects needs, wishes and desires. And (c) be able to understand the usefulness of his instruments. This means that while a market cap might sound like the single, good-enough metric - it isn't. It doesn't show any specifics for a particular project. Success cannot be measured by quantity.  We need several instruments that can shape any product on any market.

Search is dynamic and quick. It resembles the shaping of core ideas in the human mind. This means that our market-fit metric should be daily. I propose the following metrics and their descriptions (which at the end of the day all measure one thing - **growth**):

|METRIC DESCRIPTION | FREQUENCY | WHAT DOES IT MEASURE |
|:----------|:-------------:|------:|
| Unique number of active addresses that transact on-chain |  p/day | Retention |
| Number of unique Cyb users | p/day | Retention |
| Amount of cyberlinks committed | p/block | User commitment |
| % of staked tokens to circulating supply | p/block | Trust in the platform |
| Amount of delegated tokens | % of circ. supply | Trust in the platform |
| Amount of transactions | p/day | Real use case |
| Amount of active validators | p/block | Product security |
| % of tokens traded out of circulating supply | p/day | Market liquidity |
| Unique website visitors | p/month | Level of arousal or speculative interest |
| Amount of non-team members commits to the code | p/week | Technological market interest |
| Amount of side applications with active users | p/month | Adoption rate |

All of the above metrics are metrics that should be used for overall growth measurement, but they do not measure the usefulness of our specific target instruments. 

**Measurement instruments**<br>
This is a table of the block-metrics described above. Those metrics should be used as raw or as protocol level metrics. In turn, they can be used to check why and where any of the growth metrics fail.

|NAME of METRIC | WHAT MEASURES | TARGET AUDIENCE | METRIC DESCRIPTION |
|:----------|:-------------:|:-------------:|------:|
| commMetric | Community involvement | Users | Total number of posts about Cyber + links to WP|
| conMetric | Event success rate | Event participants | Number of claimed gifts after the event |
| alienMetric | Partnership and integration quality | Projects and users | Increase in tx's after integration |
| govMetric | User adoption of governance modules | THC hodlers | Amount of locked THC in proposal contracts | 
| hackMetric1 | Gitcoin success rate | Gitcoin committers to Cyber | % of paid funds to % of offered funds for issues |
| hackMetric2 | Technological interest | Open-source developers | Total number of starred (>2), active forks of Congress repos |
| researchMetric | Usefulness of Cyber research | Researches and users | Total amount of outside likes/votes on published research |
| vcMetric | Success of ongoing donations | Doners | % of target donations that is closed to ceratin date |
| fundMetric | The success of apps on top of Cyber | Cyber apps | Total cap of tokens issued on top of the Cyber protocol |
| padawanMetric | Onboarding of younger generations | Young generations | % of referencing incoming links from SN to total amount | 
| giftMetric | Web 3 onboarding | ETH/ATOM hodlers | % of claimed CYB tokens to % of held tokens on certain dates |

## The role of cyber~Congress
cyber ~Ecosystem is a part of cyber ~Congress. It is a 3 out of 5 multisig entity, where (for now) 2 keys are under the control of cyber ~Congress. As already been stated, the initial funding of the ecosystem fund is done by cyber ~Congress and cyber ~Congress is a beneficiary. 

This means that cyber ~Congress is a key player in the development of cyber ~Ecosystem (for at least as 2/5). Our goal will be to increase this number further as cyber ~Congress intends to develop the ecosystem. This interest can be observed in the gift it is giving to the Ethereum, Cosmos and Urbit communities - a 10% gift from the total supply that will help to shape and build that ecosystem. 

A key metric that can help to measure this initial onboarding is the giftMetric described above.

## Roadmap
Just like engineering work, community work is a bit ambiguous and can be vague with dates. Hence, I believe that providing concrete dates isn't correct. However, we will provide a roadmap that will be constantly updated - [right here](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/roadmap/README.md).

## Conclusion
cyber~Ecosystem will help to coordinate collaboration efforts, create communities and develop Cyber altogether. It will create cyber ~FundClassic to fund projects that will develop on top of the Cyber protocol. Work on strategic partnerships with allies that share our vision. Fund public and influential research, development, hackers and scientists. It will help to onboard communities, cross-promote products and protocols - to create a unique vision of the coming Great Web.
