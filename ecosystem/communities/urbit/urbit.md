**Work in progress (you can help to contribute via an issue or a PR)** 

### TL;DR

In our [white paper](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber/blob/master/main.tex) cyber~Congress allocates 1% of the total CYB supply to the [Urbit](https://urbit.org/) community - because Urbit is awesome. However,  if you are familiar with Urbit, you know its not a trivial project. Hence, I would like to propose the steps for gifting Urbit with CYB tokens.|

UPDATE: As promised in our WP, we have gifted the Urbit aliens with 1% of the supply. To check the balance of your gift, simply follow the ~white rabbit~ [link](https://cyber.page/#/search/0x742d35cc6634c0532925a3b844bc454e4438f44e), and swap the address for your own to see if you were lucky (use the ETH address that held the planet/star/galaxy). 

### Milestones

1) Write this proposition
2) Review this proposition
3) Include drop and grant overview (please see below)
4) Write an email to Urbit disclosing our plans
5) Propose a grant for hacking cyber~Urbit app 
6) Propose the ways to get this info to the Urbit community

### But why Urbit

Urbit is awesome. Urbit is the last frontier of the Great Web. It is THE new computer science. A new, written from scratch, 
tech-stack that completely changes the game. We believe in Urbit (not less than we believe in ourselves - that's a lot. Really). <br>
<br>We share Urbits values. It is utterly silly to believe in decentralization without Urbit. If cyber is the last answering and relevance machine you'll ever need, then Urbit is the last computer you'll ever need. <br>
For any further information [please visit here](https://urbit.org/docs/). <br>

### The gift
We need to gather information about Urbit addresses to gift Urbit. We propose to divide the 1% (which is 10 TCYB or ten trillion CYB)
into 3 categories: 30% to galaxies, 30% to stars and 40% to planets.
<br>
Hence, here are the steps that we propose to follow:
- Parse the Ethereum blockchain for Azimuth points and gather all addresses that own a piece of Urbit
- Count the % in the stake as per the above information
- Convert the ETH addresses to Cyber addresses (extracting and converting the pub. keys)
- Include this information in Cybers' Genesis block

This will give anyone owing Azimuth points the possibility to securely import their ETH private key into Cyber and claim CYB tokens.
No need to disclose Urbits master key at any point.

### The grant
Urbit has a cool open-source [grant program](https://grants.urbit.org/). What we want to achieve is to create a cyber~Urbit app, which will
essentially create a connection between Urbit and Cyber. At a very basic version, it should allow someone to: 
- View their balance 
- Manage their keys 
- Send and receive CYB tokens (sign transactions)
- Allow remote procedure calls, such as viewing block info
- Create cyberlinks (please see our paper)
- Be able to upload an [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) hash from Urbit

Our inspiration comes from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-TjZfMLqOc).<br>
 <br>At a more advanced stage, I would imagine the wrapper can control a cyber~Node from an Urbit, I mean - participate in validating blocks. 
Wrap any other calls that will be available. At a very later stage - participate in all of the governance modules of Cyber.

The grant system at Urbit is usually funded by Tlon, the company that develops Urbit. We propose to fund the project ourselves
(if Tlon decides to add to our funding, we will be glad, as we believe that our idea benefits both projects) with the following:
- A liquid payment of 1500$ in ETH to the day of payment (to be payed out upon completion of the task)
- A stake in Cyber in CYB Tokens equals to: 1.5 GCYB (to be payed out after the launch of the mainnet)

The proposal should and will include:
- A short background story, explaining what is needed to be created, referencing to this post
- A description of waht the cyber~Urbit app should look like 
- A resource guide (links to necessary documentation)
- Contribution guidelines
- The size of the proposed bounty

We assume that the work on such a solution should take between 1 - 3 weeks. The hack should be:
- 100% open-source 
- Should be submitted as a PR into a separate repo on our GitHub 
- Should be reviewed by Tlon 

### Why would this be beneficial to both projects
I think the benefit to Cyber is obvious, hence there is no need to describe it (however it is pretty much similar to Urbits benefit). Our vision and reasons behind this can be found in the above part of this document "But why Urbit". <br>
<br>To our belief Urbit will benefit in the following ways:
- Such a drop can increase the speed of the claim of the planets/stars/galaxies
- Urbit will have a wider introduction to more communities (what's important is that those are communities that share the same vision and are technical)
- Urbit is your last computer that currently lacks indexing and a ranking mechanism - cyber provides this
- An interplanetary system like Urbit needs an awesome base of knowledge inbuild into its machines and an ability search trough it - cyber provides this
- We see in Urbit a strategic ally in our mission to overthrow megacorps. Hopefully, Urbit can share this view and see us as equal. This in turns adds to the beneficial values of both
- As Cyber grows, the Urbit community will have rather a serious bag of assets in the form of CYB tokens. This will give the Urbit community more power on every scale imaginary
- Via the cyber~Urbit app the users of Urbit (and Cyber) will be able to promote Urbit by ranking the required information for this (SEO)
- Urbit can work on state of the art ML mechanisms with the help of Arvo and Cyber that can help to showcase the powers of Urbit 
- This can create a showcase for both projects and provide Urbit aliens with further gifts /drops, etc from other communities

### Conclusion 
To our belief the cyber~Urbit app and this gift to the Urbit community can help both projects to grow exponentially in the future.
To achieve this, we will review this document (as can any community member). When this is done, we will proceed with an email of intentions to Tlon, followed by a proposal and some more community announcements.
