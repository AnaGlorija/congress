## Idea

Soon according to [the whitepaper](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmceNpj6HfS81PcCaQXrFMQf7LR5FTLkdG9sbSRNy3UXoZ) we have to launch distribution games. Current state of blockchain industry is twofold: a good part is that so much innovations happening. The bad part is that huge part of that innovations, especially post-hype, are reliably covered by a thick layer of shitty projects. So we gotta find our way to break through this thick layer of shit. We believe that we have the most important sauce - [working network](https://cyber.page/brain) and [basic application](https://cyber.page). However, since our sauce consist of user generated ingredients in order to move forward the idea of better search we need *more engagement*. But how to get people know about us?

Without much ado we want to announce Open Bootstrap Evangelism Program or OBEP. Acknowledged Evangelists are eligible to 10% of all donations in ATOMs which they generated during Game of Links and Game of Thrones and more.

## Perks

- Reward in ATOM
- CYB tokens for actions
- Honourable lifetime badge *Genesis Evangelist of Cyber*
- Early knowledge of popularity mechanism in web3
- Educative communication with founding team

## Rules

There are NO guidelines or rules for the program itself. Do what you believe will work. However 2 requirements are necessary in order to receive the rewards:
1. You must become acknowledged Evangelist to have reward in ATOM. We want to exclude scam behaviour and situations when the project has been evangelised by people without proper understanding of the project.
2. You must have proof that particular donation came thanks to your amazing evangelism. Address or nickname in memo field of donation transaction is such a proof no body can reject.

## How?

Go to [cyber.page/path/evangelist](https://cyber.page/path/evangelist) and apply for the program. You either receive an acknowledgement promptly or we will contact you to ask additional question. It could be so that you will need to cyberlink a bit to have acknowledgement. It could happens so that you will be acknowledged just on the fact that you bring some donations. So don't hesitate. That is decentralization. Do not wait for approval! Please understand us! Acknowledgement is the only line of the project defence from scammers.

Once you apply, you will have your referral link, like this:
```
https://cyber.page/thanks/xhipster
```
You can append `/thanks/[yournick]/` to any cyber.page. E.g.
```
https://cyber.page/search/google/thanks/xhipster
https://cyber.page/takeoff/thanks/xhipster
```

Refferal attribution works on the first click basis.

## Whom?

Cosmos wallets, explorers, bloggers and masters of different crypto channels are welcome to participate. We know, for you it is easy. But you don't have to have some previous achievements. You can try and build your own community around idea. You decide how and what to do to achieve this. We believe this will help healthy competition between the participants of the program.

## Path

We believe it is important to understand the meat. Our great goal is to create the new verb:
```
cyber - to do something intelligent, to find something smart
```

So here is the path with necessary information.

1. Read basic materials: [whitepaper](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmceNpj6HfS81PcCaQXrFMQf7LR5FTLkdG9sbSRNy3UXoZ), [ELI-5 FAQ](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/ELI-5%20FAQ.md), [our blog](https://cybercongress.ai/post/), [Game of Links rules](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/) and [homestead draft](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md). It is not the bad idea to discover [Protoschool](https://proto.school/) and get some tutorials about how [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) works. You don't need to fully understand all of this, but  try to grasp the idea and that it is feasible.

2. Please, go on and test [cyber~Page](https://cyber.page/). Cyberlink something. Try to [search something](https://cyber.page/search/google). Go to [Game of Links monitor](https://cyber.page/gol) and enjoy our approach for decentralised launch of Superintelligence. Learn the [stats](https://cyber.page/brain). Imaging [how cool](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/usecases.md) the search could be if we learn she a bit more together.

3. Find out that everything is real and [the code is open](https://github.com/cybercongress).

4. If you have simple questions go to the [TG channel](https://t.me/fuckgoogle), but if you want to spur discussion welcome to [cyber~Forum](https://ai.cybercongress.ai/). Or you can just tweet words of kindness [to us](https://twitter.com/cyber_devs).

5. It's time to do something. Here are the ideas:

|Action  | Rewards | Terms |
|:----------|:-------------:|------:|
| [Translation](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber/issues/32) | 20 GCYB | Any language! |
| Meetup | 20 GCYB | One person - one meetup. Video proof |
| Community creation | 2 GCYB | One person - one channel. Discussion proof |
| [Content creation](https://ai.cybercongress.ai/t/mentions-of-the-beast-in-the-wild/40/55) |  2 GCYB |  Video, podcast or blog. Unlimited per person
| [Donation](https://cyber.page/takeoff)  | 1 GCYB  | For each 1k ATOM donated |

Every payout will be done only if results are cyberlinked and content proof exists.

We are not defining quality terms. But expect that if you claim reward for obviously shitty content, it's likely we will pay you out, but you can be disqualified or educated depending on your will.

Coordinator aka @serejandmyself will have personal incentive in the form of evangelist attraction. For 6th evangelist he will receive 10 GCYB. For every next incentive will be 10% less than previous.

## Source
The source of ATOM rewards are donations during Takeoff and Game of Links. cyber~Congress is responsible for paying out this type of reward. The source of CYB rewards is community pool. Coordinator will propose this program to community and will manage `1 TCYB` budget. The monetary rules are the following:
1. Coordinator paying out on the first came - first pay basis.
2. Once the budget will become empty coordinator decide on wether to stop the program or ask for additional funding through proposal.
3. If unused until the end of the program, funds returned to community pool by coordinator.

## Conclusion

We believe this program will empower the project and involve some bright minds into the [bootstrap of Superintelligence](https://cyber.page/episode-1)
