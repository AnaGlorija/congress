# Cyber: computing the knowledge for the Great Web

Cyber is a decentralized Google. It is an innovative, general-purpose search mechanism for obtaining answers.

Its mission is to create a universal search protocol to:
(a) build an open semantic field of the internet with the help of blockchain technology and cyberlinks, and (b) provide more resistance to web services through decentralization of its infrastructure.

Cyber solves the problem of creating a trustless, provable and incentivized method of communication between users who provide content and those searching for it. Cyber can be defined as a smart, distributed computer. It can process, store and compute value in the form of providing answers to questions. At first glance, this might seem like a very primitive utility, suited, maximum, for an innovative browser. But that is far from the case.

Cyber allows users to receive more by using yesterdays' tools. It can make these instruments fairer, more efficient and more relevant. The basic idea is to create an Intercommunication Knowledge Protocol that can interact with everything that matters to the user. It can be forked, white labelled or personalized.

Cyber can account for a large number of use-cases, like: unified semantics, autonomous robots, programmable semantics, personal assistants, language convergence, universal oracles, proof of location and much more. All of these cases are built on semantics.

Cyber provides useful computations! It is one of the first times in the history of blockchain technology where the computations done by the distributed
computer have obvious and useful utility, not just to the end-user, but to the whole world. The forming of relevant and provable answers, that will shape an open semantics field.

The business model is a web of dynamic properties, each affecting another, resembling the working and the economics of a well-developed country. Bearing in mind that this is a distributed computer, Cyber has computation, bandwidth and storage. Each of these is used by all or certain types of user groups to achieve certain targets, like utilizing the protocol or gaining a reward. Each group is incentivized to use the protocol and has its own interests. However, all of these interconnect dynamically to build the bigger picture.

We are a team of enthusiasts, developers and believers in a better future. cyber~Congress is an Aragon based DAO, that currently consists of 7 people. We have experience in blockchain (launching Cyber Fund, Golos, Satoshi Fund and other numerous projects) since, nearly, its inception.  At peak level, numerous of our projects had returns higher than BTC.

Over the last 40 months, we had spent \~3200 ETH. This money is primarily self-funding and the result of the initial Winter Round. Currently, the cyber~Congress DAO is looking to attract 200,000 ATOM. 

Cyber as a protocol that should and will be owned by its shareholders. It will be governed by its shareholders. Cyber will not provide KYC, AML and \ or other similar checks to its donors.
