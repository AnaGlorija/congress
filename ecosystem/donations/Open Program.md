## Open referral program for cybers donation round

**Introduction**

Cyber is a decentralized google for provable and relevant answers built with the help of [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/). 

In our [WP](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmceNpj6HfS81PcCaQXrFMQf7LR5FTLkdG9sbSRNy3UXoZ) (page 10) we have outlined the initial problems with distribution in [POS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake) networks. We believe that if the initial distribution is designed purposefully, energy efficiently, provably and transparently, access to early knowledge graph will gain in quality and size. 

The overall the distribution process is split into [3 games](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/ELI-5%20FAQ.md#what-are-the-distribution-games). 
Each game, with a different purpose for the network's deployment. During the first game, [the Game of Links](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/), a donation round takes place. The purpose of this game is for the participants to take as many tokens from [cyber~Congress](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/ELI-5%20FAQ.md#what-is-cybercongress) as possible. The better the Game of Links performs, 
the more % of the network, Cosmos hodlers acquire, the more payouts the participants in the disciplines will receive.

The donation round in ATOM lasts for either 90 days or until 600k ATOM has been donated. Depending on the results up to [100 TCYB](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/ELI-5%20FAQ.md#what-are-mcyb--gcyb--tcyb--pcyb) is allocated to the Game of Links. A detailed description of the Game of Links can be found in [this blog post](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/).

**The program**

Our goal is for the game to succeed. 
1) For the sake of the distribution and the development of the protocol 
2) To be able to fund cyber~Congress via [proposals and incentives](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress#values). 

To achieve this we want to propose an open and a fair referral program to help us to achieve the goal of 600k ATOM during the donation round. 

To do this, we want to stay as open as possible about the rules, but we must outline some guidelines to minimize the risk of the unwanted negative influence of malicious behaviour. 

We want to offer X% from each donation made via a specific category of those who help us. Below is a table of the types of possible participants and the amount of allocated % to that category:


|GROUP TYPE | % of REWARD | DESCRIPTION |
|:----------|:-------------:|:------|
| ATOM Wallets | 7.5% | Onchain wallets that are able to transfer ATOM tokens (i.e. [Cosmostation](https://wallet.cosmostation.io/)) |
| ATOM explorers | 7.5% | Websites that give reference about cosmos-related transactions, validators, etc (i.e. [The Big Dipper](https://cosmos.bigdipper.live/)) |
| Bloggers | 5% | Any type of bloggers with an audience. Youtubers, writers on Medium or hackernoon, etc |
| DR | 5% | Donation relations. People who are in offline contact with donators who wish to participate in the donation round |
| Crypto channels | 5% | Telegram or other social network groups, with a crypto-related audience, are a game |

We believe that wallets and explorers can help us to reach both of our goals rather efficiently, hence, we consciously allocate 
more to those categories.

**How does all of this work?**

Very simple. Dependent on the group above, you get **a % in ATOM tokens, after the end of the donation round, for every transaction which contains a memo with your ATOM address**. 

You decide how and what to do to achieve this. We believe this will help healthy competition between the participants of the program. 

Let's take a look at 3 possible examples: <br>
*(Please note, that those are mere examples - you decide how to participate)*
- A Cosmos explorer decided to participate. It puts out banners from cyber, integrates cyber to reference to its network stats, and finally, adds an option to connect a Ledger device to donate ATOMs. The explorer will have to add a memo field, so we will be able to identify where the transaction came from  
- A Telegram channel decides that it wants to participate. It adds a pinned message and periodically posts links to information about cyber, avoiding being annoying to its public. Here the channel administrators will have to decide how to convince each donator to put their group name in the memo. E.G. Offer chargebacks
- A Youtuber decided to participate. He makes a video about cyber. Possibly takes interviews from team members about what cyber does and why. It is once again, up to him, to decided how to convince participants to put the name of his channel in the memo

**Any guidelines or rules?**

There are NO guidelines or rules for the program itself. Do what you believe will work. 

However, to minimize malicious behaviour we must accept participants manually! We do not want to deal with scam, hence we ask all interested parties to fill out a *public* GitHub PR template, which will act as an application form. It contains the following questions:
- Your nick (no need to submit your name) (MUST match the nick on the form!)
- The group you want to participate in 
- Your ATOM address
- Some kind of contact (Keybase/Telegram, etc)
- A link to your website/blog/explorer/wallet, etc
- Your target audience and its size
- Your prefered crypto projects
- How many pages are in the cyber WP?
- In which year was google founded?
- A link to your GitHub account if you have one

Please, submit your PR [here](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/pulls), usign [this]() template!

You should **only start this if you have been manually approved by us**. We will notify you. Other than this, a merged PR with the above details into the repo means an approval. All other submissions will be disqualified. 

You MUST provide some kind of proof that the referral came from you. For example, this can be done in the form of the referral filling out a memo at the time of his donation with your nick in the memo field. The nick should be the same as was submitted in the PR, otherwise, we will not be able to identify you! This part is vital!

You may, of course, think of any other possible ways to identify yourself, but please make sure you run the idea through us first, as we will need to think of technical implementation.
