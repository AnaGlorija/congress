## :fuelpump: Section subtitle: Ground floor
Cosmonauts do not become who they are if the initial training hasn't been done properly. In this section, you will find out about some basic terminology that you will need to understand cyber, and dive right into some of its basics. Including the history of cyber, how it works, how to use it and our philosophy.

### Technical questions in plain terms
*Click on the below questions to expand the answer:*
<details>
  <summary> What are distributed technologies? </summary>
Distributed technologies are technologies that do not have a central source of power in terms of computing and storage. In terms of blockchains (distributed data ledgers), it is primarily referred to databases that are shared across multiple independent sources and have an agreement on the shared information at any point in time in those databases (are in consensus).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a consensus computer?</summary>
A consensus in computing refers to the process of different computers agreeing on some data and/or its value. For example, they might need to agree on the current time or whether or not Alice has 10 BTC (Bitcoins) on her account balance. So, a consensus computer is a computer that is involved in that process (usually used specifically and solely for that purpose).
  </details>
  
<details>
  <summary> What's a hash? </summary>
A hash means a reworking of old and familiar material. In computing, this refers to a bunch of symbols that represent a particular piece of information/data/file (more precisely, it authenticates the fact that the data represented is what it is). In other words, it is a `fingerprint`. 
I.E a sha256 hash of `cyber` is: `99100ac04db2147ef246377b1ea4fc0c17106d37286e5d61cc02201301a85bbb`. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary> What is a Merkle tree?</summary>
A Merkle tree is the name of a representation (an analogy if you may) of how some data (information) is structured (into a database). It is shaped like a tree, where there is one major root, from which others spawn and they are related to it. From those more branches/roots spawn out, until we get to the leaves, which represent the current upper level of the information. All the information can be traced from any point to any other point and is mathematically tied one to another.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a blockchain? </summary>
A blockchain is a distributed ledger into which independent participants write, and read from it - information. It is protected by the fact that it is distributed across participants computers, which are in agreement one with another at any point of a given time (past or present). A blockchain is auditable to anyone and transparent. This allows its participants to make sure that there is nothing shady happening in the background. Usually, data in blockchains is structured with the help of a Merkle tree or a Directed Acyclic Graph (more commonly knows as a DAG, which in very basic terms, is just a different way of structuring data). 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a transaction? </summary>
In terms of a blockchain, a transaction is a process of moving data. I.E. I have 10 dollars and pass them to your account. I made a transaction.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's a token? </summary>
A token in blockchain terms is a digital representation of some certain value, relating to a specific distributed ledger. It should contain some utility i.e. it should be used to do something, which in turn gives it value for the participants (users) of that ledger. It can be represented in several ways and there can be more than one token on one ledger. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is NFT? </summary>
NFT are non-fungible tokens. Meaning that they are tokens of one type, but each not interchangeable, each with their own characteristics. For example, a collectable stamp is an example of NFT. All stamps are... stamps. But each stamp has its own characteristics, value and history.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's bandwidth? </summary>
Bandwidth is the amount of information someone can pass through some resource at a given time frame. For example (which is a mere analogy), if I can move 5 stones from room A to room B in the space of one hour. Then we can say that my stone bandwidth is 5 stones per hour. Bandwidth in IT relates to information and the ability to pass a certain amount of data from one place to another.<br>
In cyber bandwidth plays a major role. It is a spam protection mechanism. It allows a user to only do a certain amount of transaction in a certain amount of time. Then, over time, it regenerates to give the user more ability to commit more transactions.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is Sybil resistance? </summary>
Sybil resistant means that it can withstand Sybil attacks. A Sybil attack is simply an attack on a system where the attacker uses a lot of pseudo (fake) identities to gain influence (usually, in terms of computational power) for himself.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is BFT? </summary>
FT is an abbreviation for Byzantine fault tolerance. It is a system that tackles the Byzantine general problem (a problem in which 4 generals need to come to an agreement of successfully attacking a city at the same time). In blockchains, each node (computer) needs to agree with one another on the current state of the network securely and efficiently. BFT is designed in such a way to help avoid the Byzantine generals problem. It is designed to achieve agreement even if some of the communicating nodes involved act maliciously. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary> What is POS? </summary>
Proof of Stake is the name of the consensus algorithm (way of agreeing) that is used in certain blockchain systems. Its main idea is to protect the system through the use of the stake of its participants. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary> What is staking?</summary>
Staking is the process of "locking" your tokens to receive rewards.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is the purpose of staking?  </summary>
The purpose of staking is network security. The tokens that are locked, the better for the system. This is done to prevent the so-called 51% attack. Which means that someone gains access to 51% of the resources and can then cheat the system in his favour. The rewards are the incentive which users receive for "locking" their tokens to protect the system.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Who or what are validators? </summary>
The validators are someone or rather a computer. Well, the word validator refers to both. Someone who runs a specific computer and the computer itself. Validators are making sure that all the transactions (communications) carried out in cyber are done correctly (i.e. that users aren't trying to cheat the system). Validators are auditable computers and their work is transparent. They have to reach consensus on the state of the ledger. And in cyber they compute (calculate) the knowledge graph that the users commit links to (they also commit links to the graph). For their work, they receive a reward from the blockchain. Which is automatically calculated by the system. Validators also participate in governance and can stake tokens to receive rewards. They can also stake delegators tokens and pay rewards out. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What or who is a delegator? </summary>
Delegators are uses that delegate their tokens to validators to participate in receiving staking rewards. For this validators might charge commission. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are smart contracts? </summary>
Smart contracts are programs that can program your protocol to behave in a certain way. For example, tell it to pay 10 coins to user A after he accomplishes a certain task. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a VM? </summary>
A virtual machine in computing is a computer system that allows one system to behave like another. In other words, it is a system inside another type of system. A real-world analogy would be the film "aliens". The alien is a VM in this case. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are knowledge graphs? </summary>
Knowledge graphs are a compilation of facts and information that provide meaning to a specific search result. I.E. if you search for Bitcoin, you might see a box on the side of the search results with lots of data about Bitcoin, what it is, where to get some, etc. This is essentially, the work of a knowledge graph. Currently, knowledge graphs use data from Wikipedia, Wikidata and other sources (which almost all, belong to google). 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's PageRank? </summary>
It is one of the algorithms used by google to rank search results. At a very basic level, it is based on the principle of counting incoming, quality links. Based on this information it decides what website should be ranked higher.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is web3? </summary>
Web3 is the next evolutionary step in the development of the web. A step that takes away from centralisation of search and social services and away from things that are depended on a single functioning unit (have a central source of authority). It is a step that desires to see involved counterparties and applications communicate directly one with another. In agreement with each other, whilst also, be motivated for this behaviour. And as a result, achieve a safer routing of data and packets (information exchange) on the web.<br>
Often, you might notice the term `Great Web` in our documents. For us, The Great Web is a much better-suited name for the more common term `web3`.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is IPFS?  </summary>
IPFS is a peer-to-peer (directly connected between two users) protocol, that is designed to make the web faster, safer, and more open. IPFS makes it possible to spread across high volumes of data and keeps every version of your files. IPFS makes it simple to set up networks for mirroring data. This means that data is pretty much immutable or if you may - everlasting.<br> 
IPFS helps to further distribute the web amongst peers (users). It enables constant availability — with or without internet connectivity. You can share and view files, manage large chunks of data, build applications, etc. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's governance? </summary>
Governance is the process via which the users of the ecosystem decide on what's going to be funded, how it is going to happen, etc. They do so via a voting mechanism.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a DAO? </summary>
A DAO is a decentralised autonomous organisation. It is a unity of users that mutually decided on the governance of something. This can be a protocol, a fund, an organisation, etc. A DAO does not have a physical representation. It is represented with the help of cryptography and code. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's Aragon? </summary>
Aragon is an application for creating decentralized, autonomous organisations backed by code rather than by centralised law. The distributed code becomes the law, where participating users have a say and an incentive for participating in the application/protocol. One may create global, bureaucracy-free organizations, companies, and communities with the help of Aragon. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are prediction markets? </summary>
Prediction markets are an example of communicating and financial incentives between actors (users) of an open market. A user can say "It is raining now" and back this information with data from a local weather station. Others may agree or disagree with this statement based on evidence provided by the initial predictor. He may put at stake his reputation or money. What this provides us with, is a system where rather than trusting a centralised source for providing certain information, we have a large number of independent sources, providing their opinion on a certain event with evidence. Hence, creating a provable and auditable service for some type of data (usually backed with a financial record). 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's an entity?  </summary>
An entity is an existing thing. An entity exists and that's all it needs to do to be an entity.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's a foundation? </summary>
When talking about construction a foundation is the lowest load-bearing part of a structure or building. When referring to organisations, a foundation is an entity that is managing the governing questions regarding its actions/structure, etc
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's a congress? </summary>
Congress can be a group of people picked by others to make challenging decisions. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a hardware wallet in terms of crypto?  </summary>
There are numerous ways to store your cryptocurrency (tokens). There are hot wallets. A hot wallet is one with access to the internet. There are two categories. One is when you own your private key (the good way) and in the other - is when you don't own your private key. For example, if you keep your tokens on an exchange (that's a bad way - do not do this!). You should always remember one simple rule: `Not your keys - not your crypto!`<br> 
There are cold wallets. Which are pretty safe if are created following a normal set of guidelines (plenty of guides around the internet). A cold wallet is one that does not have access to the internet. This can be a paper wallet or a physical wallet (either a metal device or a hardware wallet that never had access to the net).<br> 
Finally, there are hardware wallets (they can also be hot or cold). A hardware wallet is a small digital device which requires physical access to make a transaction. Usually, they come in the form of a slightly bigger than your typical USB stick which you can connect to your PC and you need to press buttons physically on the device to do anything.  Of course, this drastically increases security, even if the device is considered hot.

### Introduction
**Q:** What is cyber? <br>
**A:** Cyber is a decentralized google, for provable and relevant answers.

**Q:** What is the main mission of cyber? <br>
**A:** Its mission is to create a universal search protocol to (a) build an open semantic field of the internet with the help of blockchain technology and cyberlinks, and (b) decentralize the infrastructure of the web with the help of blockchain

**Q:** What cyber is NOT? <br>
**A:** Cyber is NOT a commercial product. It is not a product as such. It is an instrument if you wish or a tool, that anyone can use. That said, cyber allows for several ways for its participants to earn rewards.
Cyber is NOT the new internet. It is a tool that can help to shape and to decentralize (distribute the power of authority) the new Great Web and the services it has to offer.

**Q:** How does cyber work? <br>
**A:** Cyber is, essentially, creating a brand new protocol (a procedure that helps computers to do things in a certain way) for adding and searching information onto a knowledge graph (a compilation of facts about something that provides meaning to the user). And rank this information. In other words, it's a decentralized google.

Users create links between 2 IPFS hashes (*hint: essentially, an IPFS hash is just a representation of some data*) and place them on a knowledge graph by spending bandwidth (amount of data that can be transmitted over a fixed period of time). Users also link IPFS hashes linked to keywords, which helps to enrich the knowledge graph with... *knowledge*.

That content is then dynamically ranked with the help of digital tokens and the current parameters of the networks load. This makes the rank dynamic (characterized by continuous change, activity, or progress).

All this is computed (determined with the help of a computer) by validators (a program or a computer that are responsible for checking the validity of something). The validators do so, by using their GPU's (literally - graphics cards).

This allows to search data on the web, rank it, query it (look it up) and create knowledge databases without blackbox intermediaries (third parties that try to censor data, hide or push specific results to obtain money, track your data, etc).

The interesting thing is that such a simple mechanism allows creating a lot of powerful tools as a result. We will go in-detail further down the document into those. For example: unified semantics, SEO instruments, autonomous robots, and a lot more.

**Q:** What is a relevance machine? <br>
**A:** Quite often throughout our explanations we refer to cyber as `A Relevance Machine`. The simple explanation lies in the meaning of the words themselves. cyber acts as a verifiable and provable intermediary for relevance between any two objects at any point and time. In other words, cyber can prove that A was relevant to B at a certain place, at a certain time and under specific conditions. 

When a user creates a cyberlink, he expresses the will to do so by backing this cyberlink with some weight in CYB tokens. In other words, the user submits to the knowledge graph what is important for him. The meaning extraction for knowledge in the case of cyber is incentivized. The submitted cyberlinks are dynamically ranked and project relevance to those who submitted them. 

Cyber uses Merkle trees to build proofs for the submitted links, creating a provable and auditable chain of information down to the root. The more agents inquire the knowledge graph, the more valuable the knowledge becomes. Based on this, the relevance between cyberlinks can be computed. Via querying and delivering answers in such fashion, a simple mechanism is constructed - the relevance machine. 

**Q:** Why cyber? <br> 
**A:** We like that name. That's one reason. We have been using this name throughout our projects for the past 6 - 7 years.

Actually, cyber refers to anything that is very smart. The meaning is rooted in the word cybernetics (check out this article on Wikipedia) - a science which describes the behaviour of dynamic systems with feedback loops.

In popular culture, it has become a partial synonym to all the crazy sci-fi things out there. Like the cyber-track by Elon Musk and co. Cyber refers to cyberspace. Space free from centralized, human influence and bureaucracy. It is the Andromeda of freedom. The last frontier...

### The history of cyber
The idea of cyber was incepted in late 2016. The original white paper was written by [@xhipster](https://github.com/xhipster) while still working with cyber·Fund. In 2017 a team of engineers began working on developing the project, that was then called cyber·Search. 

The idea behind cyber·Search was to create a blockchain agnostic explorer, that would enable anyone to search for any metadata within any blockchain. We have a small [retro landing page](https://cybercongress.github.io/cyber-search/) left from those days. 

After some time the team behind cyber·Search left and cyber~Congress was born. If you are curious, [watch those videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpI87MxJymc) to see how it happened (*hint: you can also watch some of the original cyber·Search videos on the same youtube channel*). 

(*hint: you may also see the [launch roadmap](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#full-launch-roadmap) for a historical timeline*)

The team was dedicating time to research and building. As time progressed, so did cyber·Search. The team grew, the idea grew and eventually, the results of good research, skilled engineering and the development of blockchain technology, led to the transformation of cyber·Search - into cyber, along with the birth of cyber~Rank, the mechanism that ranks information in cyber.  

The idea grew bigger and bigger until at one point it became what it is today. cyber wasn't an explorer anymore, it was now a global and innovative search mechanism for the new web.

The current white paper took 3 years of work to complete. The team that stands behind cyber changed pretty much altogether, but the original idea of making a universal and an intelligent search still stands (*hint: you can see the current team [here](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/teams/cybercongress.toml)*). 

The idea of cyber is still developing. But today it's not raw anymore. Today cyber has a clear vision of abolishing the chains of digital slavery through decentralizing the semantics of the web and its services.  

### The philosophy behind cyber
To understand cyber one first needs to understand its philosophy. Our work isn't simply technical. We base our work on our values. If it wasn't for them, we were not be building cyber. To be completely open about our intentions, I will jump into the story of the team behind cyber, and how values are our core driver. The core team knows each other for several years and has worked together previously. At one point, a few years ago we separated our ways, only to realize that whatever we do, we do not share values of others, hence, bringing the team back together.

What do we believe in? Firstly we believe in freedom, privacy and decentralization. We share and propagate the vision of improving this world. We believe that evil stands behind a centralized, bureaucratic approach to technology, governance, communication protocols (money), etc.

We do believe in code. We believe in innovation and in making use of our knowledge to make the world a slightly better place for our children. With that in mind, what we are trying to say, is that cyber and cyb are not just technological results. They are much more. At its base lay the values of the team behind cyber. We hope that our project can re-create certain values of what we believe the blockchain paradigm stands for. 

*Q&A on the philosophy behind cyber:*

<details>
  <summary>What problem are you trying to solve? </summary>
We are trying to solve the problem of data centralization and data censorship. Which in other words, is the decentralization of common knowledge (assuming that data is the new knowledge and that we are moving into the digital age).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why are you doing this?  </summary>
Each person should be able to control their own data, their identity, their knowledge. The universe can become a better place if our children live in a digital environment where they are in charge of their actions.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's wrong with google?  </summary>
google is a brilliant idea. We do not deny this. But google is the rebel that has overthrown the dictator and became the dictator itself. google uses you to shape the essence and the fundamentals of communications between everyone and everything. Whilst at it, google doesn't care for anyone and will make money on your action and your behalf.<br>
It should be noted, that by this question I am attempting not just at google, but at all the mega-digital corporations. Feel free to check out what this can lead to in the shape of [Cambridge Analityca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica). If this case is too much to take in or too "loud" for you, feel free to watch some episodes of Black Mirror to see how digital control can "break" society.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why now? </summary>
Because we are almost done with post-industrialism. We are slowly and surely moving into the digital realm. One can deny or accept this. Now is the time to either have the tools that will help us to shape the matrix the way we want to shape it or give those powers away to someone to control all aspects of our lives.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why search? </summary>
Search is a global mechanism that is globally understood by everyone, regardless of language, race, age, etc. It is somewhat a basic instinct (searching for food to survive, etc). In the digital realm with the help of search, we gain answers to our questions, which we always ask. Search helps us to build a model around any subject that is of interest to us. With the use of search, we can build databases, which can lead to a great number of useful instruments (on these later).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Aren't there other, more important problems to solve? </summary>
There probably are. But we decided to focus on this because we understand how to achieve the required result. There are probably more problems and questions to be solved (like hunger, wars, ecology, etc). Our tool can help to play a role in solving if not all, but some of these.  
  </details>
  
<details>
  <summary>Aren't there other things out there that solve this? </summary>
There is a lot of awesome, open-source technology on the market that can commit to making a change in the world. Most of the technology we use is not something we invented (although the code itself is written from scratch!). They are technologies that have existed previously and are awesome at doing what they do. Our software is a combination of existing technologies, protocols and our work that has arisen from this. It is specifically targeted at fixing what is broken.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How can users/developers/others benefit from using such a system in comparison to google, etc?  </summary>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/7hX2GbQC/cyber.png" />
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why do you need consensus within Cyber? </summary>
A consensus is required for nodes to agree on the current state of the ledger at any given point of time. This is needed to achieve security, transparency, immutability and decentralization. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is your take on: privacy/censorship/routing? </summary>
We believe that privacy should be a fundamental right. As of now, the protocol is pseudo-private (just like Bitcoin is). I.E. you know which hash linked something and with what weight, but you don't know the real name of the user. With that, we are planning to implement full privacy into the protocol.<br>
We are strongly discouraged by any censorship and view it as a sin against any living and/or thinking organism.<br> 
Routing should be always permitted. Transactions should always be permitted to pass. Otherwise, this is censorship. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do you not think that the motto #fuckgoogle is offensive? </summary>
Fuck no! Fucking is not for pain, it's for pleasure!
</details>

### The cyber~Congress DAO and its role
You already learned about the inception of cyber~ Congress. If you missed it, catch the videos of the birth of the original cyber~Congress [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUfxwbONrtEFeCHOA3gHT-g/videos).

cyber ~Congress was set up as a DAO. The initial intentions of cyber ~Congress can be found [in this document:`the evolution of species`](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/README.md). Today that manifest is still being worked on and is still in development. 

cyber~Congress helps to launch the protocol, commits to the code base, helps to gather the initial community, write the initial documentation, organise the distribution and deploy the Genesis. The Congress lives in Ethereum, as an Aragon DAO. It is responsible for organising the Game of links and the minting of THC tokens.

As of today, cyber~Congress is a 2/2 DAO for decision making and a 2/3 DAO in terms of security. However, it should be noted, that some decisions are already wider diversified as the whole team that works on the DAO takes part in most of the decision. In the future, we hope this will become automatized and the DAO will grow. 

There are 3 points on which we should touch when discussing cyber~Congress:
1) cyber~ Congress is the launching DAO behind cyber. For its work, a 14.3% share of the governing token, THC, is allocated to cyber~Congress. This share will be staked during cyber ~Auction to receive an equal amount in CYB tokens. This means that the congress will be a functioning entity in the life of the protocol. However, cyber is a community governed protocol. From the numbers above, one can tell, that the majority of the stake is going to be in the hands of the community. The protocol will be governed by the validators and the community via a governance mechanism, proposals and prediction markets.   

2) The manifest outlies the idea that all species should (and will) have an equal opportunity for secure and transparent communication. Intelligence can be simplified to communication. All species can communicate via electromagnetic impulses (including robots). If they can communicate (which they can), they can prove their existence and pass on a signal and receive an answer. This is intelligence at its most pure form. The main mission of cyber~Congress is `To help the evolution of species!`

3) cyber~Congress as a DAO plans on developing cyber, taking part in the governance, launching `cyber~FundClassic`, an ecosystem development fund, that will help cyber to evolve (*hint: further in the document, a whole section is dedicated to the description of the ecosystem*), form strategic partnerships and buidl applications. The DAO plans to stake the received ATOM tokens from the first donation round to its Cosmos [fuckgoogle validator](https://cosmos.bigdipper.live/validator/cosmosvaloper1e859xaue4k2jzqw20cv6l7p3tmc378pc3k8g2u), and support the incentives of the team via the received rewards. The DAO also plans to have a sustainable income flow, described in [this issue](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues/302).

## :computer: Section subtitle: Prepare for take-off

>  Masters become masters when they learn. You are done with exploring and are ready to buckle up your seat belt. It ain't Kansas no more...

This section will get you acquainted with all the bits and bobs there are to cyber. This includes all of our projects, our community plans, the launch process and how to get some fuel to bootstrap yourself to save the galaxy, most importantly this section teaches you how to become a hero and validate cyber!

### Using cyber: The very basics of becoming a master

#### Connecting to cyber
First of all, let's explore the possible ways to connect to cyber. In further classes, you will find out about other ways of connecting with the beast. But for now, we will stick with the very basics. Read the information carefully, as few paths are safe, some might seem safer but have hidden obstacles, not seen to the naked eye.

##### cyber~Page
We suggest you start your acquaintance with using cyber from [cyber.page](http://cyber.page/). It is a small taste (it is, currently, in alpha mode) of an IPFS based search application, that allows one to search for semantically enriched and dynamically ranked IPFS content, with the help of the cyber protocol.

First of all, one needs to watch the short, Episode 1 story at the beginning (giggles are on us), by clicking `Play story` (just press the space bar on your keyboard if you wish to skip the story):

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/KzPkY6qv/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-14-45-15.png" />

Just turn on the speakers and enjoy the journey:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/85NWLkrr/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-14-47-34.png" />

You are now on the main page. Rest assured, it's working. Let me remind you that when google introduced their notorious sear bar, people were ready to kill. We think simple is good. Black is sexy:

(Notice how the eye in the top right corner is not red, but green? This is because since those screens were taken, we have integrated an IPFS node into the app, which lets you pin and search content right from a P2P network)

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/6q7QvFzv/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-14-49-02.png" />

Try clicking the search box in the middle and search for something original like `cyber`:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/yxzZ717N/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-14-51-12.png" />

This will return some results:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/RV3DBcjW/Screenshot-from-2020-03-24-18-51-12.png" />

Those are sparks (snippets), containing cyberlinked hashes, that someone linked, enriched semantically and here they are. The numbers next to the hashes are the current ranks.

The sparks don’t look fantastically attractive. But they will be later. They will even be alive and P2P-style interactive in the future. Let’s click on one of the results (please be patient, the network is still slow and the first time around it might take a while until something loads - this is peer discovery. More so, there is a possibility something won’t even load, as it was unpinned):

(Of course, the results are dynamic, the first hash led me to the cyber WP. Let us know what results you got)

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/DwY5nXHy/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-14-56-16.png" />

BTW, did you notice the paper clip next to `paste a hash`?  Because there is an integrated IPFS node, you can actually pin anything you want to IPFS using this paper clip and it will become immediately searchable thanks to cyber. I will go over in detail on how to do this next time (let's see if you can figure it out on your own for now).

Let’s click on the brain. That purple essence in the top left corner:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/YqQhpKP4/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-14-58-58.png" />

This will take us onto the main knowledge page:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/GtcSH1Qc/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-15-00-01.png" />

Here, you may explorer network statistics, validators, economic parameters, % of staked tokens, bandwidth price, etc. To do this, simply click on any of the buttons. I.E. `Cybernomics`, `Bandwidth`, etc

Notice that the top box, at the top, becomes searchable. You can perform search actions from here too. More so, cyber doesn't just understand keywords, it also understands addresses. For example, try searching an ATOM or an ETH address:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/QM0M3GTk/Screenshot-from-2020-03-24-19-02-40.png" />

It does say that it doesn't know what it is but notice the `Check your gift` button underneath. Click it. This will, most likely, take you to the gift page:

(Cyber gifted 10% of its supply to [ETH](https://www.ethereum.org/), [ATOM](https://cosmos.network/) and [URBIT](https://urbit.org/) hodlers)

If the address was lucky and got gifted, you will see something like this:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/vTRTP7np/Screenshot-from-2020-03-24-19-04-23.png" />

Give it a second to load and calculate the results. The page loads the results from a decentralized database (a blockchain), it can take up to a few seconds to calculate this.

(Otherwise, the results will display gift:0)

You can also click `PLAY`, which will take you to the [GoL rules](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/). The currently incentivized testnet of cyber. 

Now, try clicking the robot in the top right corner: 

(Notice, that when you hover over it, it displays text with links, feel free to explore them)

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/4x9nxKxQ/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-15-10-44.png" />

This takes you to the Ledger page:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/0rgRWN19/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-15-12-14.png" />

If you click the bottom button `Put Ledge into the pocket`, it will offer you to connect your Ledger (on this, later on, with different guides):

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/jd8kS5F2/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-15-14-03.png" />

Notice that the network is still learning, so if you type in something cyber isn't aware of yet, you will be displayed with this:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/gk93qPLs/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-15-15-24.png" />

However, you will see a result. This is a hash that takes you to an explanation page if you click it:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Qdf2WmYQ/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-15-17-12.png" />

Let's go back to the brain by clicking it:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/YqQhpKP4/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-14-58-58.png" />

Notice, how there is a message box, right under the top search box, saying you need tokens. Click on the `Game of Links` green link. This will take you here:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/25cLJsc1/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-15-19-38.png" />

Here, you may find details about the Game of Links, its distribution. Check out the `Masters path` (builder of the Great Web) or the `Heros path` (validators of the Great Web) by clicking on either. The results will help you to understand more details.

For now, we will finish the initial sign guide for [cyber.page](http://cyber.page/). When you use this guide, you might discover that since its inception, new features have been added. Even now, some pages like the [governance page](https://cyber.page/governance), are already being tested.

##### cyb~Virus
The virus is a Chrome extension made to #fuckgoogle right in Chrome. It was originally made as a project during an IPFS hackathon and since then, due to technical reasons, been archived. It can still be used, though it is NOT safe to import your private keys into the extension! 

cyb~Virus is capable of downloading any web2 page into IPFS and enriching it with a searchable keyword for cyber in 2 clicks. However, due to technical limitations, we have archived the project. 

You may still find the code in its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb-virus).

Please note: it is NOT safe to import your private keys into the app. We cannot guarantee the security of this application for the time being!

With that in mind, you may still install it and use it. Let's try to do it:

Head straight over to the [release page](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb-virus/releases) and click on the `Assets` button. You will see the extension file.zip, download it:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/CL1HGXbF/Screenshot-from-2020-04-23-11-34-44.png" />

The file will be saved in your `downloads` folder or in any other directory you saved it. You will need to unpack it. Simply head over to the file and unpack it into a separate folder.

Now open up your Chrome browser. The extension sonly supports Chrome!

Go to settings and then click on extensions or simply put this `chrome://extensions/` into your browsers window, and click enter:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/L57qBCMX/Screenshot-from-2020-04-23-11-38-49.png" />

In the top left corner, click `Load unpacked` (please note that you might need to enable developers mode for this. To do this, simply click on the `Developers mode` on the same page, in the top right corner). A window will open, asking you to choose a folder, head over to the place you unpacked the extension, click on the folder (do not open the folder itself) and click open (I called mine `CYB`, but yours can have a different name):

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/XJPNTr11/Screenshot-from-2020-04-23-11-41-41.png" />

If you did it correctly, you will see the cyb extension appear:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/4x4dHRc5/Screenshot-from-2020-04-23-19-43-20.png" />

Click on the extension in your extension panel in the top right corner. *Hint: As Virus isn't safe to use for importing keys and transactions, the only reason why you would want to use it is for downloading pages into IPFS and obtaining a hash for cyberlinking via cyper.page.*

Click get started and create a wallet. A page with a seed phrase will appear. You can save it and as a matter of good principle, you should. However, as mentioned, this address might not be safe. Enter a password and move forward. The app is installed and is ready to be used. 

All that you are interested in, is the `Download page to IPFS` button. Go onto any page you want to do this for (make sure your browser allows javascript) and click the button (you don't need a balance for it, it's not a chain tx):

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/xT27R0tK/Untitled.png" />

After you click the first button, click `save`:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/d10NhBm3/Untitled1.png" />

This has the IPFS hash of the file, which you can already use. Copy it. If you now try any IPFS gateway, you should be able to see that file in IPFS. 

##### cyb~Snap
Snaps are a [metamask](https://metamask.io/) extensions that allow developers to integrate non-Ethereum chains into metamask and use it. To install snap you need to manually upload it from GitHub to your browser extensions.

cyb~Snap will allow integrations for almost all Cosmos based chains and act as a multi-chain wallet, just like metamask is for ETH. 

For cyber snap will allow for linking content from web2 to web3 via a few clicks. It will also act as a wallet and will allow utilizing other features.

You may find more information about the snap in its [household repository](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb-snap). PRs are welcome!

A dev preview of cyb~Snap:

To be continued...

#### Using cyber.page for Masters
Just like a baby makes their first steps and learns about the world that surrounds them, we will explore cyber.page piece by piece, to get a better understanding of its capabilities and the wide variety of options.

##### Using your Ledger to link
The main purpose of cyber is to cyberlink aka to create an open semantic field for web3 and to enrich the knowledge graph with... knowledge that can be used by anyone, anywhere, anytime. 

In the future, the process of making links will become easier and easier. Right now, there are plenty of bugs and fixes that cyber.page as an app undergoes. But, regardless of these, it works. So let's try to use our Ledger device and create a link:

First of all, you will need a Ledger, for the purpose of this guide I am assuming you have one. If you don't and you wish to acquire one, please do so only from trusted sources! I advise you to check the ledger [official webiste](https://www.ledger.com/) first for any local dealers near you in [this section](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/retailers/). Please note, that we are not affiliated with Ledger, so please make sure you double-check all of this yourself.

As a second step, you will need the Cosmos app installed on your Ledger. To do this, you will need to install [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/pages/ledger-live) (only do so from their website!). As Cosmos is not on the App Catalog by default, you will need to activate the developer mode.

Go to settings and simply allow dev mode `ON`:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/CxW9bCNk/1-9l-BQWse4k-F7-Nr-MCEXM32-Q.png" />

Once the developer mode is activated, you can come back to the app catalogue and you should normally be able to find Cosmos on the list:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/RhyL2dqT/1-741r-Qcm-FCs-L6gn-EMz8h-Wyg.png" />

Click `install` and you are ready to move on.

I advise you obtain some ATOM tokens, as you will need those to make transactions within Cosmos (not cyber). Still, it might be a good idea to test how staking and transacting works in Cosmos, as it is very to cyber.

For this guide, I will skip on how to use your ATOM wallet, as there are plenty of those you can find on web2 and maybe even in cyber, or link on of these to cyber yourself =)

Onto the next step. To create a link with Ledger, you will need some CYB or EUL (depending on whether it is a test or a live net) tokens. There are a few ways to obtain these:

1) Whilst this is still a testnet, you might as for some in the [fuckgoogle TG channel](https://t.me/fuckgoogle) and people might send you some
2) Get some from [the faucet](https://cyber.page/gol/faucet)
3) Get some from [Kira's TG bot](https://t.me/kirainterex)
4) Obtain them by [running a validator node](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/validators/onboarding.md)
5) By [playing GoL](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/)
6) By participating in any of the rounds (see `beep beep beep` section)
7) Via claiming [a gift](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Gift%20FAQ%20and%20general%20gift%20information.md)

It seems, that the easiest way now is to use the bot to get some tokens (unless you had a gift). Then, simply send them to your own address (see the sections below). Your EUL or CYB address will be generated for you automatically the first time you connect your ledger device to the app. Let's do it.

Open cyber app:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/bY5Zk0LY/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-13-15-01.png" />

Click on the Green eye of the robot in the top right corner. This takes you to the Ledger page:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/mkcXn1JN/Screenshot-from-2020-04-17-12-45-17.png" /> 

At the top wee the box, calling you out to play GoL. We will explore this in a seperate section. Lets continue for now. As you can see at the bottom, you may aslo press `Put read address only`, this will allow you to enter a cosmos address and to work in view-only mode with it. But we need the real thign here!

If you click the button at the bottom, `Put Ledger`, it will offer you to connect your Ledger (follow the steps on the screen). 

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/jd8kS5F2/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-15-14-03.png" />

This will bring us to the [pocket page](https://cyber.page/pocket). After you connect your device, you will get to a page which will display your Cosmos address and your cyber address, with the appopriate balances if you have any:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/y85dqMDm/Screenshot-from-2020-04-17-12-51-43.png" /> 

If you see EUL tokens and not CYB tokens, this means that the network is still in testnet, don't worry about this.

Once again, lets ignore the Game of Links section for now and explore it later. Also the box stating that you made links previously, will only appear of you did make them!

Your balance is most likely to be 0 unless you had a gift. If you did, you will have some tokens on your balance. If not, use one of the options above to obtain some tokens. When you make links you aren't spending any tokens. But, cyber is architectured with a bandwidth model. This means that every time you make a transaction (i.e. link) a portion of your tokens gets frozen. Your bandwidth regenerates over time, allowing you to make more transactions. This is a simple spam protection mechanism. 

From here, you can click your cyber address. This will take you to a menu where you can see your available balance, the links you made, what heroes (validators you vote for), any mentions, etc:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Xq5x4jxT/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-13-24-17.png" />

Try clicking `Cyberlinks`. If you haven't previously made any links. Nothing will appear here, of course. Lets finally try and link!

In the box at the top, type in a search word you want to create a link for. Let's say you want to link something about music, then you would type `music`. If you wanted to link something about proteins, you would type in `proteins`. Watch your caps and your plurals. For the time being cyber doesn't know how to work with either plurals or caps. This means that it searches for strictly what you type. I want to link something about rain:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/brPSSqqX/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-13-26-31.png" />

Hit enter. In this case, nothing was found: 

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/nzGc5Bf5/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-13-29-52.png" />

This means that cyber still doesn't know what rain is and I can enrich the knowledge graph. Good.

I wanna link a picture of rain, as I'm a visual person and I think that this will easily explain what rain is to whoever then searches for it. At the bottom of the page, you will see `paste a hash` and a paper clip:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/V6G2dkqv/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-13-31-44.png" />

Click the paper clip to upload a picture!

(Now, I advise uploading pictures that are free and don't have any restrictions. But this is up to you what you do)

When you click the paper clip it will take you to a normal upload page:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/NfwZFST1/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-13-34-50.png" />

Pick your image and click `open` in the appeared box!

You can see that it has the name of the image in the box at the bottom. To the right of it click `Cyberlink using Ledger`:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/15PYs6hB/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-13-35-45.png" />

If the Ledge device isn't connected, you will need to connect it as described above, if it is, you will see something like this:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/0jB7FLpb/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-13-37-21.png" />

Click `Cyber it`. As you can see the screen tells you to confirm that the transaction matches what is on your Ledger. Make sure it does and use your Ledger to move the arrows right until you confirm the info:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/8kytQY4p/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-14-46-18.png" />

When you get to the View or Sign transaction, move the arrow down by using the right button on Ledger and click `Sign transaction` by clicking both of the buttons simultaneously on your Ledger:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/4dHtD8xd/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-14-49-40.png" />

You will see a transaction submitted screen and it after a second or two, the page will reload with a result:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/XYvZM22b/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-13-43-31.png" />

We have taught cyber what rain is. Good!

Let's click the result. This will take us to a separate page and open your picture n IPFS:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/bwKq6LWL/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-13-44-23.png" />

Cool. But it seems to me that this picture is not obvious after all... The page is still open and I wanna upload an HTML page that will explain what rain is. I prepared an HTML page of a dictionary explanation of what rain is. It was very simple. I just found the page that I wanted to use, right-clicked on the page and clicked `save as`. This saved an HTML file of the page I choose. 

I can now go back to `paste a hash`:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/gjSW3K3V/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-13-47-53.png" />

And click the paper clip and upload the HTML file of rain. Click `Cyberlink using ledger` and follow the same steps as described above. The result is this:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/VNqPKwjL/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-13-49-28.png" />

Not perfect. I know... But at least there is a picture and a description of what it is we wanted to teach cyber. We have committed 2 links to the knowledge graph and anyone searches for `rain` will find our result. Anyone cyberlinking our rain to other things will be starting here. Pretty cool, ah? 

You can link videos, music files, pdfs, etc. The link is your oyster. For now, they do not show perfectly on screen and there are lots of fixes that the app is undergoing. But it fulfils its initial purpose. We managed to submit something to the open semantics field of web3. Who knows, maybe whatever we submitted will once become one of the most searched for things on the new Great Web...

##### Sending tokens 
As you guessed, by far this is not all the app is capable of. You probably noticed that it acts as an explorer, allowing you to check balances, transactions, vote for validators, etc. You can also send tokens by using the app and your ledger. Click on the green eye again:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/fRgf1Sf8/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-14-53-29.png" />

Click on your `cyber` address:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/G2rjr1q8/Screenshot-from-2020-03-30-15-23-25.png" />

At the bottom of the page click `Send EUL using ledger`:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/YSBP4Zdk/Screenshot-from-2020-03-30-15-23-49.png" />

You will need to enter a valid cyber address that you want to send tokens to and the amount in GEUL (1 GEUL = 1 million EUL). Note that your balance is shown in GEUL. So to send 100k, enter 0.1:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/W4KxNzxW/Screenshot-from-2020-03-30-15-24-22.png" />

After that click `generate transaction` and simply follow the instructions on your Ledger. When you made sure the information on it matches the info on your screen, hit `sign transactions`, just like when you were linking and the app will generate the tx:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/RhRBZ97W/Screenshot-from-2020-03-30-15-25-15.png" />

You may click `continue` to carry on linking or click `View transaction` to see your tx:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/g2w2NXy4/Screenshot-from-2020-03-30-15-29-30.png" />

##### An in-depth explorer
cyber.page allows you to use it as an in-depth explorer. There are two parts to this. One is investigating transactions related to your own account and the other is being able to read general chain information.

Let's start with general information. Click on the brain in the top left corner:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/7L6x3HnY/68747470733a2f2f692e706f7374696d672e63632f59715168704b50342f53637265656e73686f742d66726f6d2d32303230.png" />

You will see this screen:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/k51Ws5rj/Screenshot-from-2020-04-08-11-42-08.png" />

The first box underneath the search box and the statement, has some numbers in it. This is the height of the current block and the current chain id. Click on them:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/8CXNz2WJ/Screenshot-from-2020-04-08-11-43-45.png" />

We see lots of information. This is detailed information regarding each formed block in the chain. We can see a hash of the block, its height (sequence number), the amount of the transactions that each block contains, the proposer address (the hero involved in making sure it's all good to go) and the timestamp in UTC. As you can see all the `height` numbers are clickable. Let's click on one:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/sfqxchMQ/Screenshot-from-2020-04-08-11-47-23.png" />

This is how a block without transaction looks. Nothing interesting, apart from the same information we have seen on the previous screen. Let's open a block with transactions:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/BZk5KtsN/Screenshot-from-2020-04-08-13-38-16.png" />

We can see lots of information, including the amount of the transactions that were made on this block and the list of the transactions themselves, along with their type, status and timestamp. The tx id is clickable and will take us to the detail page that we already have seen.

Let's get back to the main page of the explorer:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/k51Ws5rj/Screenshot-from-2020-04-08-11-42-08.png" />

There are 5 more buttons underneath the box with the chain id. The `Main` (pressed by default), shows us the number of cyberlinks in the ecosystem, `eul` cap in ATOM (with regards to takeoff round) and heroes. If we click on the heroes button we will see the validator page:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/tTmfK6f8/Screenshot-from-2020-04-08-13-31-31.png" />

We can see active and jailed heroes. Let's go back and explore the other buttons. The `knowledge` button tells us how many links, objects and subjects there are in the chain. The `cybernomics` button, tells us the current supply, the takeoff price and the current cap in regards to takeoff. 

This is the `consensus` screen:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/zGtcbKDv/Screenshot-from-2020-04-08-13-33-39.png" />

We can see the heroes tab (if we click it, it will take us to the validator page again), the current inflation and the amount of staked tokens and current transaction amount. Let's explore it:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/0jhp1598/Screenshot-from-2020-04-08-13-35-32.png" />

We see a list of the chain transactions, along with their status, tx id, timestamp and type of transaction. The types are self-explanatory. The tx id is clickable and takes us to the page with the information about the specific transaction:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/y609DK6S/Screenshot-from-2020-04-08-13-36-48.png" />

We can see various self-explanatory information. The `from` and the `to` addresses at the bottom are both clickable and will take us to their pages, which will show us what we will explore below. The block height (that included the transaction) is also clickable. 

The last button is `government`:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/8kwvRHW1/Screenshot-from-2020-04-08-13-40-00.png" />

Both buttons here are clickable, the `community pool` button will take you the governance page, which we will explore in a different section. The `network parameters` page shows lots of different parameters that are modifiable via governance, we shall explore this later. For now, feel free to explore the page:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/cJ2WyPVs/Screenshot-from-2020-04-08-13-42-36.png" />

Now, let's explore the other side of the explorer, related to information of your own account.

Click again on the green eye and then your `cyber` address:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/0j8pwdwV/Screenshot-from-2020-03-30-15-31-44.png" />

You can see your address underneath the search box, your balance, a menu and breakdown of your balance. Click on the `Txs` (transactions) button:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/CxhSQvyF/Screenshot-from-2020-03-30-15-32-58.png" />

Here, we can see all of our transaction related to this address. The type of the tx lets you know whether this was a link, a send or any other type of transaction. The `status` on the left lets us know whether it was successful or not. There is a timestamp and a link to the tx detail. If we click on a link, it will take us to a new page with the details of that particular transaction:

Let's click the `Cyberlinks` button:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Y9BwH84D/Screenshot-from-2020-03-30-15-36-36.png" />

Here we can see all of the cyberlinks that we did. The tx hash (once again, this is a link to a new page with the details), the timestamp and a `from` and a `to` columns. Those are the 2 hashes we used to create a cyberlink.#### Claiming the gift

##### Claiming the Gift
The good thing about cyber is that it has a really good architecture and that it uses a bandwidth model to prevent spam. This means that you need tokens to transact. Transactions are free, but you need something to freeze. After a while, you will run out of bandwidth and it will regenerate again. It acts as a protection unit.

We have gifted 10% of our supply to Ethereum, Cosmos and Urbit holders. This means that you can claim the gift, play GoL and transact. Awesome.

The not so good thing is that currently, claiming the gift is a bit of a process. If it was your Cosmos address that got the gift, all you will need is a Ledger device. Connect it to the app (cyber.page) and voila. You will see a balance. We will go into detail how to do this below.

 If you had an ETH or an Urbit address, then the only safe way to do it now is to use cybercli (CLI is the abbreviation for command user interface). But don't worry. All you need is just a few simple commands and you are ready to go. Of course, in the future, this will change and the process will become more user friendly. But, it's a good reason to learn a few extra tricks!

You will need a notepad, your PC and a Ledger (yes, this too). First of all pocket your Ledger as described in the previous sections by clicking the green eye on [cyber.page](https://cyber.page/):

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/0j8pwdwV/Screenshot-from-2020-03-30-15-31-44.png" />

Please make sure that you have enabled experimental features and downloaded the Cosmos app on your Ledger. If you are unsure about this step, please go a step back and see [a detailed guide on how to do this](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#using-your-ledger-to-link). Get to the stage where you have connected your device and clicked the green eye.

You now see two addresses. A `cyber` address and an `ATOM` address. If at this stage your balance is not 0, you are lucky and got a Cosmos gift, you won't need the rest of this guide. Just skip over to any of the other parts of the guide and enjoy.

To make sure you don't waste your time, make sure you did receive a gift. 
Open another window with cyber.page and enter the address you think might have a gift in the search box:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/L8YV7N3N/Screenshot-from-2020-03-31-21-26-29.png" />

Press enter. On the new page click on `check your gift`:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/pd7rSJkY/Screenshot-from-2020-03-31-21-27-09.png" />

If the address was eligible, you will see a result like this:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/0yKyww9z/Screenshot-from-2020-03-31-21-27-46.png" />

Go back to the other tab, where you have your Ledger plugged in. You will need your `cyber` address. Even though the balance is 0, click on it:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Xq5x4jxT/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-13-24-17.png" />

At the very top, underneath the search box, you see your address and a green `copy` symbol to its right. Click it. Open any note pad and paste the address into the note pad. We will need this for later.

Excellent. We now get to the hard part. 

Depending on what system you are on, open your terminal. There are a zillion of guides for how to do this on the internet. I picked [a random guide](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/open-command-window-terminal-window-specific-folder-windows-mac-linux/). If you're on Windows, make sure you open it as an administrator (right-click and open as admin). If you are using something else, you probably know what to do.

In the terminal type:

```bash
bash < <(curl -s https://mars.cybernode.ai/go-cyber/install_cyberdcli_v0.1.6.sh)
```

This will connect you to a remote node and allow you to enter commands without actually running your own node. Try:

```bash
cyberdcli --help
```

You should see this:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/d0kBTnxz/Screenshot-from-2020-03-31-19-54-36.png" />

Congratulations! You are halfway there. If you're running into issues while doing this, hit us up on our [TG chat](https://t.me/fuckgoogle).

I will skip the intro on how to use the CLI, if you want to learn more about it, check the [CLI guide](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#cli-guide). We just need to import an account. Depending on what type of account you have, you will either need your private key (for Ethereum and Urbit). Make sure you have those. Your keys are stored locally on your computer with those operations, so they are safe. 

As this is an ETH address you will need its private key ready. A note, even though the procedure is safe, I would advise not to use this ETH address anymore. This is a normal practice in crypto to do so. Note the private key in the note pad (If you're planning on using the ETH address in the future, I advise you type in the key and not paste it into the notepad).

Before we move forward. Let's make sure we are connected to a trusted node. You are welcome to connect to any node you trust. You need something that looks like this: <http://node_address:port>. You can connect to one of our nodes.

Enter this into the terminal:

```bash
cyberdcli config node <http://node_address:port>
```

Let's import the address. In the terminal type in this command:

```bash
 cyberdcli keys add private <your_key_name>
```

Or in other words (make sure you drop the < and the >):

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/tg6qJZh9/Screenshot-from-2020-03-31-19-55-16.png" />

The name doesn't really matter here. It's just a reference.

The system will ask you to enter a passphrase. Do it:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/zXDTh5ts/Screenshot-from-2020-03-31-19-55-44.png" />

And, then enter your private key. Either paste it from the notepad or type it manually:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/tg7jn1Ws/Screenshot-from-2020-03-31-19-57-42.png" />

This will not return anything. That means all is good. So far this is how the process should look:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/gjt5Wst4/Screenshot-from-2020-03-31-19-58-06.png" />

Let's make sure it worked. Type in this:

```bash
 cyberdcli keys list
```

We should see our account:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/g2KY9FqK/Screenshot-from-2020-03-31-19-58-48.png" />

Copy the address that begins with cyber and paste it into the notepad.

We now need to send the tokens from this account to our Ledger device awe are ready. The send command looks like this:

```bash
 cyberdcli tx send <from_key_or_address> <to_address> <amount_eul> --chain-id euler-6
```

Copy it into the notepad. Instead of the <from_key_or_address> enter the address you copied from the terminal, instead of the <to_address>, enter the cyber address of your Ledger (the one you copied at the beginning). Then enter the amount you wish to send, followed by eul without spaces in between. Test it first. Your command should look like this:

cyberdcli tx send cyberADDRESS-THAT-YOU-IMPORTED cyberADDRESS-FROM-YOUR-LEDGER 100eul --chain-id euler-6

Hit enter. And confirm the transaction by typing `y` when the terminal prompts you. Press enter again. If it was good, you should end up with something like this:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/sfNYdbD7/Screenshot-from-2020-03-31-21-46-17.png" />

The 0 in the `code` field, means that the transaction went through. Wait a minute or so. Let's make sure it has.

Go back to cyber.page and the green eye (you should still have it opened). Check if you see your transaction in the tx field:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/vThZr48C/Screenshot-from-2020-03-31-21-49-04.png" />

If you do, congratulations. Send over the rest of the balance. You are now ready to play! 

##### Choosing your hero
Heroes are the validators behind cybers infrastructure. They are the titans that stand on guard, making sure you can sleep safely at night (and day). 

Heroes get rewarded for their work via inflation. Masters (i.e. delegators) can also be eligible to part of those rewards. This is the process of staking. You delegate your tokens or part of them) to a certain (or several) heroes and because they are staked, you are now, too, eligible to receive some rewards. There are of course some `but`. For one, heroes may (and rightly so) charge a commission fee for from delegators. This allows them to pay for the infrastructure costs that they have. Two, you should be careful choosing a hero. If a hero misbehaves he will get slashed (punished). For example, if a validator node double signs a transaction, the node will lose part of its bonded (staked) tokens. Along with it, delegators will suffer too. This means that you should look out for things like a heroes reputation, commits to the chain, his reasons on launching and running the node, maintenance of the node and other things that might let you know more about them. Three, it is highly advisable to spread your stake (balance) amongst several heroes. This helps decentralization and reduces the risk in case a hero gets slashed. 

Remember. The more tokens are staked, the safer the network.

But first... What rewards can be expected from delegating? Well, as this is still a testnet, it is highly difficult to tell. You can estimate by using [stakingrewards calculator](https://www.stakingrewards.com/asset/cyber).

On [cyber.page](https://cyber.page/), click the brain in the top left corner:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/YqQhpKP4/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-14-58-58.png" />

(I am assuming, you already plugged in your Ledger, to the app, at least once before or have it connected)

This takes you to your flight deck:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/tJhwnWYg/Screenshot-from-2020-03-30-17-52-38.png" />

The top row shows your balance and your balance as a % of the current supply. You may also see the current block height and the chain id. The lower row shows the number of cyberlinks in the network right now (the size of the knowledge graph). The current EUL cap in ATOM and the number of heroes that are in consensus right now. 

You may also notice a middle row with a menu. Explore it for yourself or go back to the [first section of the guide](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#cyberpage) to see what it's about. 

We need the heroes button. Let's click it:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/BQfCntHX/Screenshot-from-2020-03-30-17-57-12.png" />

Here you can see the list of active heroes and those that are jailed. Jailed heroes means that something happened and the hero needs to be unjailed. You may also see a button at the bottom `Become a validator`, [explore it in this section](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#nut_and_bolt-section-subtitle-mama-im-an-engineer).

Of course, we will concentrate on the active set. Let's explore the table first. You can see the moniker (aka nickname) of the hero. The commission rate that you will have to part with. In other words, this is how many percent you will end up paying to a validator for his services. This is what will be substrated from the earned tokens. 

You can see their voting power (the more that is delegated to them, the higher it is). A % representation of this to 100%. Their self stake or how much they are staking on themselves from what is delegated to them. And finally, your bonded stake, if you already delegated anything to them. 

Let's try and delegate (for the sake of the guide I am taking a random validator that is currently at the bottom of the list). Click the validators name:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/KzBrFy96/Screenshot-from-2020-03-30-18-03-50.png" />

We can see a page with some details. Their voting power. Their uptime percent (the more the better). And a cool menu. Let's explore the menu first of all, as this can help us to make a decision on whether or not we want to stake with this validator. The `main` button is already clicked. Here we can see details about the operator address. The commission. Self stake. Max commission rate and delegator shares. The latter gives us another view into how much is delegated to this hero and what is self stake. 

The `fans` section shows details about who delegated to this hero:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/fTcdbKf9/Screenshot-from-2020-03-30-18-07-31.png" />

Clicking on one of the addresses will take us to a separate page with the details fo that address:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/HnLNLxfJ/Screenshot-from-2020-03-30-18-09-37.png" />

Feel free to explore this page. But mainly this is something we have already seen in previous sections. Only this time we can actually see a better breakdown of the balance due to rewards earned from delegation. 

The `burden` section shows the last 300 blocks. Ideally, they should all be green. This means that the validator hasn't missed any blocks lately. The `Rumours` section works like mentions. If the hero was mentioned, you will see it here (*hint* delegations are also mentions). And the `Leadership` section, shows us transactions to do with running a validator:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/m2mHMrKL/Screenshot-from-2020-03-30-18-13-27.png" />

Once again, all the transactions are clickable and will take you to the page of the detail. We can see above transactions to do with submitting a proposal to become a validator, depositing tokens and voting. Feel free to explore those.

Let us finally delegate something. In the bottom left corner, you will find a `Stake` button. Hit it and this brings us to the delegation page to the particular hero we clicked on. You can also see your address and your balance. Lets delegate 0.1 GEUL :

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/VvXLgzfk/Screenshot-from-2020-03-30-18-19-46.png" />

(Follow the on-screen steps for your Ledger to connect it if it still isn't and open the Cosmos app)

Enter this in the amount box and click `Generate tx` (make sure the information that is on the screen matches the information on your Ledger device and sign the transaction on your Ledger (just as with linking).

This brings us to the confirmed transaction page:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Tw55g8Bt/Screenshot-from-2020-03-30-18-21-53.png" />

You can either view the tx or carry on. We've already been over the `view` part in previous sections. Let's click on `continue`.Depending on what page you were on when you clicked `Stake`, it will take you back to the same page. Let's click the `Fans` page:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/tTdZ2dC6/Screenshot-from-2020-03-30-18-25-46.png" />

We now see that there is an additional address here. This is, of course, ours. Notice that at the bottom of the page there are now extra button, `unstake` and `restake`. We'll ignore them for now. But those also let you know that you are staking on this particular hero. 

If we click on our address, we will again arrive at the main explorer page of the address. But this time we see a reward:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/1t0BwNkC/Screenshot-from-2020-03-30-18-27-49.png" />

Rewards get recalculated as fast as the network commits blocks. Think of it as if you had a savings account and getting interest every few seconds, rather than per year. We cal also see the amount of the total tokens we delegated to all validators. In this case, it matches the amount we just delegated. 

You can keep an eye on your delegations by clicking the green eye, then your cyber address. And finally the heroes section:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/9QJrRXgd/Screenshot-from-2020-03-30-18-32-19.png" />

##### Picking honey
As previously stated, when you chose a here and delegated your dough to him, you are now too, eligible for some honey. 

As in the previous guides, connect your Ledger device, open the Cosmos app and click the green eye on cyber.page:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/fRgf1Sf8/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-14-53-29.png" />

Click on the `Heroes` tab. You can see your hard-earned delegation reward and a `Calim reward` button at the bottom of the page. Click it:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wvyNJmPM/Screenshot-from-2020-03-31-20-40-02.png" />

If your Ledger is connected, you will see a pocket and a `Generate transaction` button. Click it:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/YCV7yL0Q/Screenshot-from-2020-03-31-20-40-21.png" />

Make sure the information on your Ledger matches what you see on the screen. Scroll right until you get to the review and sign transaction stage. If everything is ok, sign the transaction. You will see that it's gone through. Press `continue`. Let's make sure that the bird is in the cage. Click on the `Txs` button to see a list of your transactions:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/T1DQfwXL/Screenshot-from-2020-03-31-20-40-58.png" />

You can see that the last transaction is what we are after - claiming rewards! As usual, you can explore it by clicking the tx hash. 

##### Playing GoL
By now your level of expertise as a master should be on level 42. If so, let's move onto the main section of the master level. Playing the Game of Links. 

There is so much info about GoL in this guide, that I would recommend using `Ctrl-F` key combo and search for what it is. A long story short, it's a game to help distribute CYB tokens from the pot of cyber~Congress into the hands of those who want them. The game is made for heroes, evangelists and masters. However, anyone can join and play. You don't need to have a node running to get rewards. In fact, if you've managed to complete the above levels and got as far as here, you are good to go.
One more thing before we look at the detail. The experience you will obtain from here will carry on serving you throughout the life of cyber. As the game is based around linking... and so is cyber.

Before we explore the `gol` page, you should know that the quickest way of looking at your rewards and the current breakdown can be seen on your personal `flight deck`. You already know how to get there. On cyber.page, navigate to the green eye, then click on you `cyber` address. By default, you are on the `main` screen. We need `GOL`. Click it. This is your personal GoL dashboard:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wjWLhMcM/Screenshot-from-2020-04-08-14-51-30.png" />

You can see all the disciplines, which we will explore, one by one. The max available reward, the current (to be paid out in the future) reward. And most importantly, `CYB won` section, which is what you won, if anything, so far. And the same representation in percentage.

Let's be brave this time and teleport straight to the [GoL section of cyber.page](https://cyber.page/gol). It's fairly easy to get here manually. Go to cyber.page, click on the brain in the top left corner and at the bottom of the page you will see the `Game of Links` button (in reality, there are quite a few buttons taking you here, just use whichever you like most). In all of the cases you will end up here:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/nLQkKt8M/Screenshot-from-2020-04-17-13-05-10.png" /> 

As the statement above says GoL is a game and you can play and get rewarded for it. There is up to 10% of the supply allocated for the disciplines. That's a lot! Feel free to check out all the rules of GoL by clicking the `in the organizator's blog` [button](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/) in the statement at the top.

Underneath that statement, you can see 3 boxes. The current network load, the donation goal and the fulfilment of the validator set. All of them influence the prize fund in one way or another. We will explore this later. In short, the more donated ATOMs there are, the bigger the prize fund. 

Below that, there is a table, which we already saw in your personal dashboard. We can see the amount of CYB allocated max to each discipline (some are dynamic as described above) and the tokens you won. Don't spend too long on this, but do get familiar and try to understand the numbers. It is important. 

BTW, each discipline is clickable and takes you to its own page, with an explanation or the appropriate action page. Feel free to explore!

Let's move on. We need the `Masters path`, click on it:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/zXpwkKCY/Screenshot-from-2020-04-02-17-47-04.png" />

As you can see there are 4 buttons, those are 3 disciplines and the `Takeoff` button. Let's explore them all one by one. By default, the `Relevance` discipline should be clicked (like in the above picture). 

- Name of discipline: Relevance
- Explanation: The gist is simple, the higher the rank of the content submitted, the better
- Dependant on donation takeoff round: Yes
- Explanation: The more ATOM tokens are donated during takeoff, the higher the reward pot for this discipline is 
- Reward: up to 15 TCYB for the top 1000 CIDs and the top 10 masters that linked those CIDs
- Explanations: Submit content that is relevant to everyone, link it, the higher the relevance of your content to others, the better
- How to play: You already know how to link. Read about it [here one more time](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#using-your-ledger-to-link). Second, make sure you show some love to your links. Link them with more weight. Become a whale yourself or get whales to be interested in what you do. How you achieve this, is up to you. *Hint*, watch out for the top CIDs on this page at any point. Be the first to follow that strategy and relink them. In other words, think of this as following a traders strategy. Just like when you follow your favourite traders' decisions, however, if too many people get ahead of you, the market reacts and the decision will probably lose relevance.

Ok, let's move to the next one, `Load`:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/nrSzXFDg/Screenshot-from-2020-04-02-18-01-18.png" />

- Name of discipline: Load
- Explanation: Spend as much bandwidth as you can on submitting links
- Dependent on donation takeoff round: Yes
- Explanation: The more ATOM tokens are donated during takeoff, the higher the reward pot for this discipline is 
- Reward: Up to 6 TCYB for those who spend bandwidth on submitting links for the period of GoL
- Explanation: The bandwidth is dynamic. This means that if the network load is low, you can end up spending on 1000 links as much as you would spend on 10 if it wasn't low. This means that it is good if more people are submitting links and doing it all the time
- How to play: The bandwidth spent on linking is called `Karma`, I suggest you remember this term, it will be used heavily throughout the protocol. So the more Karma you have, the better. Think of this is useful reputation based on your actions, rather than words. How to win? Submit a lot of links. The more you link, the better the chance of winning

The next discipline is `Community`:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/ZnWmDrWs/Screenshot-from-2020-04-02-18-08-53.png" />

- Name of discipline: Community
- Explanation: cyber is governed by the community. Use the governance [module]() to submit useful things and get rewarded if they get accepted
- Depended on donation takeoff round: No
- Explanation: Does not depend on how many ATOMs are donated during takeoff round
- Reward: 2 TCYB 
- Explanation: There are 2 TCYB to be distributed. 1 TCYB will be spent on [OBEP](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/donations/obep.md), our evangelist program, where you can get rewarded for spreading the word about cyber and doing good deeds. The other TCYB will be distributed via looking at the usefulness of your governance proposals
- How to play: Mainly be as active as you can and make sure it's useful. There are 2 ways to achieve this. One is via [community governance proposals](), *to be continued*. The other is via participating in OBEP. Become an evangelist, translate the WP, organise a meetup, write useful content, etc. Check out the [details here](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/donations/obep.md)

There is one more button left, the `Takeoff` button. Let's click it:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/dQCwd9KD/Screenshot-from-2020-04-02-18-17-00.png" />

This is not a discipline. But the idea is twofold:

- The more ATOMs donated, the higher the rewards for some of the disciplines
- If you donate ATOMs, you receive CYB

Where to get ATOM? Good question. This is entirely up to you, but here is a link to [CMC and available markets](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cosmos/markets/). 

Pretty simple. So what are you waiting for? Go and link...

You may, of course, explore the 2 other ways of the Jedi. The `hero` path and the `evangelists` path. But we will skip them for this section.

##### Using the faucet to get tokens
What do you do if you didn't get any tokens as a gift and you want to play? Or you want more tokens to play with?

Use the test\~Auction or [the faucet](https://cyber.page/gol/faucet). We have released an in-detail [blog post]() on how to use it. If you haven't read it, check it out. Otherwise, stick with me (but please check out the post for more detail).

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/02DP4zpC/Screenshot-from-2020-04-17-13-23-30.png" />

The page seems a bit difficult to use. Trust me, it isn't!

First of all, I would suggest you turn on your Metamsk extension. If you turned it on after visiting the page, hit the refresh button on your keyboard (F5). 

There are 5 boxes on the top. The current round of the auction, the total amount of ETH spent the current price of one Giga GOL per ETH (remember that these are testnet tokens!). The time left until the end of the current window and the cap of the test tokens in ETH.

The chart shows a theoretical price for one Giga GOL in ETH at each window of the auction. The price could and will change as more ETH is donated. 

You can donate on any open window. Use the box below to contribute. Enter the amount in ETH and the round you want to participate in and hit `confirm`. At the bottom of the page, a notice with the tx hash will appear. You can view the transaction on Etherscan or press OK and wait for the confirmation.

Once the round is closed the "claim" button should be available to grab the tokens you've won. Push it and follow the instructions of your metamask extension. 

For your comfort (making transactions), you should add GOL tokens to your metamask account by adding the following contract address (once again, this is very simple and there are lots of guides on how to do it, for example [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II7VMo5Nl7k)):

```
0xf4ecdba8ba4144ff3a2d8792cad9051431aa4f64
```

Once your tokens are in your pocket you can vest EUL tokens on a 1:1 proportion to any `cyber` address. The vesting page is available by clicking `vesting`, in the box above the chart, or via [a direct link](https://rebyc.cyber.page/vesting).

Please note, that you may need to connect the extension if you still haven't!

If your metamask account is connected and you already have GOL tokens on your balance, you should see the total amount of GOL vested and available to transfer. `Vested` GOL tokens are the tokens you already vested to get EUL tokens. It means that these tokens are frozen for transfers. `Available` GOL tokens are the tokens you can vest or send. `Total` is the sum of vested and the available tokens together.

To get EUL tokens you just need to pick the amount of GOL tokens you wish to vest and a `cyber` address for transferring EUL tokens. If you have previously connected your Ledger device to cyber.page, the app will automatically fill in your cyber address for you (of course, if you want to vest to a different address, you need to change it). Push the "Create vesting" button, read and check the summary and push "Create TX". Follow Metamask instructions. After the transaction is confirmed you can see an entry in the table below with the amount of GOL tokens vested, a date, a `cyber` recipient address and a hash of the transaction for the `euler` network. 

The GOL tokens you have just vested will be moved to the `Vested` section, and the `Available` for transfer amount of GOL tokens will decrease by the vested value. 

Congratulations!  You have EUL tokens for interacting with the `euler` test network!

##### Exploring the knowledge graph
By now you should be a real master and I will show you a secret trick. But shhhhh. Don't be telling anyone! 

You've been working hard on linking day and night, trying to get some tokens, right? What could be better than seeing your work painted by an artist?

In your browser, go straight to the [page of the graph](https://cyber.page/graph)... Enjoy!

This is a visualization of the knowledge graph. Twist it, zoom in, zoom out. Just remember to stop looking at it after a while.

##### Takeoff 
You might have gotten here yourself while you were exploring GoL. If not, just head over to the [takeoff page manually](https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff).

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/zGrPGB4p/Screenshot-from-2020-04-17-13-16-25.png" />

Underneath the statement box, we see the 5 main metric boxes, the end of the takeoff, the number of ATOM tokens left till its end, the amount of CYB allocated (remember how they are all dynamic, right?), the current takeoff discount and finally, the price per one Giga CYB in ATOM. 

Above the chart, there are 3 buttons. By default, the `main` button is clicked. This shows a theoretical chart. As time progresses, so does the amount of donated ATOM and the amount of allocated CYB grows. The more ATOM is donated, the more CYB tokens are allocated. The discount falls. This means that the earlier you donate, the higher your discount is if more ATOM tokens are donated! 

At the bottom of the graph, we see the countdown to the takeoff timer! Keep an eye on it!

### Using cyber: Advanced Master Class
What can be better than moving to the next level of mastering a skill? Mastering a skill even more... I hope that this section will be filled in by the masters themselves as they get to know cyber and their karma levels grow.

#### Crawlers
We didn't plan to implement crawlers for the time being and, in all honesty, we believe that crawlers are the works of those wishing to improve their reputation. Apps launched by heroes and market makers. But, as life happens, so do crawlers. Thanks to [`sta`](https://cyber.page/network/euler/hero/cybervaloper1hmkqhy8ygl6tnl5g8tc503rwrmmrkjcq4xvhhf), we have our first crawler.

What are crawlers? They are little robots that crawl the web in search of knowledge and bring it in the form of transactions to be signed by the master and added to the knowledge graph.

I hope to see the list of crawlers grow so big, that it will be impossible to describe how to use each one of them and this document will just be a link to each crawler out in the wild. For now, there is one and here is the guide on how to use it:

The crawler lives in [sta's GitHub](https://github.com/SaveTheAles/arxiv_crawler), you are welcome to star the repository and to follow his (fuller) installation guide.

Before we kick off, make sure that you are running [the latest version of IPFS desktop](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#ipfs-desktop), [cyberdcli](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#cli-remote-node-and-account-managment) is installed and so is [python3](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/). Also make sure that you have a [charged cyber account](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#claiming-the-gift) and get yourself familiar with [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/), as that's the website we will use to crawl.

arXiv is a free distribution service and an open-access archive for almost 2 million scholarly articles in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics. 

Let's start:

1) Make sure you install the necessary python libraries on your machine (do check that you are installing the libraries under the user you are going to be running the script from, i.e. sudo or your daily user, if you have one). Go to your terminal and enter these commands one by one, making sure each one is completed. If you run into trouble, feel free to explore the internet on why this can happen (in most cases we encountered are `pip3` problems, which required upgrades of python):

```bash
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install arxiv
pip3 install multi-rake
pip3 install ipfshttpclient
pip3 install progressbar
```

2) Go to the [repo of the crawler](https://github.com/SaveTheAles/arxiv_crawler) and download it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SaveTheAles/arxiv_crawler.git
```

3) Make sure that you have imported the cyber account you going to be signing transactions from into the CLI. [Check out this section](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#account-management). If you are importing a Ledger account, you can prepare your Ledger

4) Go to arxiv.org and explore the website. Find what it is you want to upload to the knowledge graph. arXiv lets you create [complex queries](https://arxiv.org/help/api/user-manual#Quickstart), but for this guide, we will stick to the simple things in life. I will be using the keyword `physics` for the guide

5) In your terminal, go to the folder of the crawler:

```bash
cd arxiv_crawler
```

6) We need to prepare the config files. Let's do it. The first one is `config.py`. Open the file with `nano config.py` and edit the `address` and the `query` field:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/h4bgtPmd/Screenshot-from-2020-04-23-17-32-16.png" />

Save the file.

7) Edit the `main.py` file with `nano main.py`. You need to pick the number of max_results you want to see. I will enter 50:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/L8PxmhYd/Screenshot-from-2020-04-23-17-37-52.png" />

8) Edit the `sign-brod.sh` file. Open it with `nano sign-brod.sh` and make sure that you enter your account name (NOT address!) where required. The account name is the name you chose for you account when you imported it into the CLI. Check [this section](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#claiming-the-gift) if you forgot. You need to edit the `for` to make the `i` suit your `max_results` and the transactions themselves:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/d3M8Hj6L/Screenshot-from-2020-04-23-17-40-12.png" />

We are nearly ready.

9) Let's launch the script with (make sure your IPFS desktop is on and running):

```bash
python3 main.py
```

This should take some time depending on your internet connection and produce some results, similar to this:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/yNvQbt3W/Screenshot-from-2020-04-23-17-58-46.png" />

Because we chose rank 4.0 in our config file, the results that have a `4.0`+ grade will be searchable with the keywords assigned to them (in brackets) in cyber, after we broadcast the transactions.

10) This produced a `data` folder with the papers in IPFS and a `txs` folder, in the data folder, with the transactions to sign. Go to your terminal and let's try to sign the transactions. If you are using a Ledger, make sure its ready and the Cosmos app is open. Also, make sure that you are under the user that created the keyring when trying to sign the transactions:

```bash
./sign-brod.sh
```
You might need to do this command, before running the script:

```bash
chmod u+x sign-brod.sh
```

11) Each tx, the Ledger will ask you to confirm, to broadcast and to sign the transaction. The end result should look similar to this:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wjFZC7S6/Screenshot-from-2020-04-23-18-27-30.png" />

If you see a timeout error, this is probably to do with your internet connection or the proxy node you're using. If you're seeing the `too many tokens` error, this means that there are more than 7 messages in the tx. Ledger can't sign more than 7. If you're seeing the `permission denied` error, this means that you're most likely not under root or the address in the config file, doesn't match the one you're using on your Ledger. make sure the addresses match and if you are seeing the permission error, simply do `sudo chmod 777 /PATH TO FOLDER` to give the user that has the keyring permission to create files in that directory.

12) And you're done! You can use any of the produced hashes to check on cyber.page or just go to [your tx page](https://cyber.page/pocket) and see the transactions!

#### CLI for Masters

### Guru Masterclasses
Here you are. A young padawan, standing proud in front of the Gods. What else awaits you on your journey? Only the Gods know... and in all honesty, they are too, unsure about your future. 

For now, this section will remain purely theoretical. As cyber grows, so will this section and the possibilities of how to use it.

#### Monetezation
How do you monetize content with cyber? Can a Master make use of cyber in such a way that it will help him with important things like basic income? Is this a loud statement? Possibly. So was Einstein's theory of relativity just a little over 100 years ago. Could you have understood how to monetize blockchain tech in early 2010? Unlikely, But! If you were into digital tokens, economics, game theory and tech, most likely you had some ideas, regardless of their possible implementation. Ther is a drastic gap between luck and an educated, based upon facts, theory. 

By now you are probably familiar with some of the mechanics of cyber. Later in this document, you will learn more and more about it, including its possible, endless use cases. You are also aware of semantics, advertisement tools on the internet and how the two are connected. There is more... There is e-commerce, there is monetization via services, etc. All this requires data, semantics, economic incentives for actions, computation and knowledge. Cyber provides just that. 

We cannot say for granted that you may do this or that with cyber, but we can certainly put forward an educated theory. If semantics is under your control and the control of everyone if users of the internet can work with decentralized instruments, rather then centralised services. If anyone can provide a service based on this semantics, decided how to index content, rather than trusting a blackbox intermediary... then maybe, it becomes possible to build tools, even for users, rather than just developers. 

Of course, you need developers to build the tools, however, e-commerce, SEO or other things do not require many skills to start. If I can influence a keyword-relevant to me at any moment to be searched, I am working with SEO. If this keyword is `buy second-hand chairs in Spain`, then I can see how I can use it to my advantage as a re-seller or if I work in production. If I can buy something right in a spark (a snippet of a search result) I will do it. If I can subjectively create a local oracle of data, I can use it for my own benefit (or the benefit of someone else). The possibilities are really endless. 

Are there many ways of monetizing the internet? Yes. They are endless. Apps, data, on and/or off-chain apps, consensus apps, selling, buying, etc. The beauty is that there is no 3rd party. There is no middle man. The downside is that all of the above requires time, developer adoption, user adoption and so on. But, this is not a downside. It is your early ticket to the Great Web. Be the builder of the web yourself. Create the rules. Make suggestions. Buidl. Hodl. Be a true master of your own destiny!

### IPFS / Cosmos & Tendermint
A lot of the time, cyber is asked: why Cosmos? Or why IPFS? <br>
Here are the answers:

 <details>
  <summary>How do you use IPFS? </summary>
   cyber uses IPFS as the current backbone on which users perform the search. Think about IPFS for cyber, as of the fridge, and cyber is the lightbulb inside of it. Users use IPFS to store and publish content and files. cyber lets users rank, index and find it. If there was no lightbulb, how would you find food in the fridge during those hungry nights?
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>Why is IPFS better than other protocols? </summary>
  cyber does not claim that something is better than something else. However, IPFS is revolutionary. It is the first protocol that created content-based addressing, which allowed cyber to build cyberlinks on top of it and change the way we search for information. 
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>What other protocols are you planning to use? </summary>
 cyber plans to be protocol agnostic. For both stateless protocols (in which no session information is retained by the receiver): IPFS, Swarm, DAT, Git, BitTorrent, or stateful, such as: Bitcoin, Ethereum, other blockchains and tangles. This means the cyber is smart enough to understand any type of protocol is taught and can truly become the backbone of search for the Great Web. 
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>Why do use Cosmos/Tendermint? </summary>
  (1) When we started to build Cosmos was already in mainnet. (2) Cosmos has IBC, a protocol that allows for data transfer between sovereign blockchains. (3) We share the decentralized, non-monolithic philosophy that Cosmos preaches. (4) The security of Tendermint and Cosmos-SDK is top-notch 
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>How do you use Cosmos? </summary>
  Cosmos provides the consensus mechanism for cyber. We use Tendermint as an engine that helps the network to reach agreement on its current state, perform transactions on the blockchain, validate search results, etc
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>Why don't you use Polkadot or other solutions? </summary>
  For now, others do not exist. Polkadot was still tested when we started. Also, we tend to agree more with the philosophy of Cosmos and we hope to be connected to Polka via bridges and relayers when they finally arise.
  </details>

### cyber~Metagalaxy
cyber is a galaxy of smaller components. Why? The simple answer, is why not? The other answer is that we want to divide the work evenly and equally amongst several entities that are each responsible for their field of work. Most importantly, this work has to be done efficiently, and breaking it up into smaller parts - helps a lot. A browser is an application, while the protocol is the protocol. They are not one entity. Same goes for the governing process. Different entities are responsible for different questions.

**A visualization of the metagalaxy:**

To be continued...

**Selected questions about the componnets that make up the galaxy:**  
  <details>
  <summary>What is cyber? </summary>
cyber is the name of the protocol that holds everything together. Think of it as black matter. 
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>What is cyberd? </summary>
cyberd is the name for the backbone of cyber and a name of the GitHub repository where the cyber protocol lives.
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>What is Cyb? </summary>
Cyb is your friendly robot/personal browser application. One one hand it is a mere browser. But it isn't. The problem is that there is no such word as of now that describes what cyb is exactly. It is a browser in the sense that it lets you search for things. But it is your personal applications, that can understand many other things. It can act as a wallet. It can act as a database. It contains your cyber-space robots. For now, we call this a browser. But I would imagine that something along - a personal customizable web application, provides a better description.
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>What is cyber~Page? </summary>
cyber~Page is the gateway of the protocol. It allows you to search for things. Obtain results. View statistics. Use governance procedures. It is part of Cyb.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>What is dot~Cyber? </summary>
dot~Cyber is another name for cyber.page: a reference interface for the cyber protocol.
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>What is cyber~Congress? </summary>
The congress is the DAO behind the launch of the protocol. The initial intentions of cyber~Congress can be found in the Evolution of Species. The congress helps to launch the protocol, commits to the code base, helps to gather the initial community, write the initial documentation, organise the distribution and deploy the Genesis. The Congress lives in Ethereum, as an Aragon DAO. It is responsible for organising the Game of links and the minting of THC tokens. The congress will launch the protocol, hand it over to the community and remain a functioning entity that commits to the code, improves the protocol and makes it an intergalactic product.
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>What are the distribution games? </summary>
This is described in a separate section in detail. In short, those are the technical games that help cyber~Congress and cyber to achieve a better distribution for the protocol and the governance tokens.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>What is the vesting app? </summary>
The vesting application is an app used to vest your tokens during cyber~Auction and claim a 1-1 equivalent amount of tokens in the cyber blockchain after the end of the auction. 
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>What is governance in cyber? </summary>
The cyber protocol is governed by its users. We will talk about specifics further. But, the idea is that it is the users that should decide, by coming to a majority agreement, on what is and should be happening in terms of development, what rewards they should receive, how should a certain something work and so on.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>What is cyber~Foundation? </summary>
It is a community governed DAO. The role of cyber~Foundation is to help the community govern the protocol via an Aragon DAO. It is a fund managed via a decentralized engine, charged with the donated ETH and managed by the community (agents of the protocol).
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>What is cyber~Ecosystem? </summary>
It is the entity that is responsible for helping to grow the ecosystem. Its common goal: to build a better and a unique new web: the Great Web. To achieve this it will help to form partnerships, onboard communities, help research, connect people, do VC work when necessary, create and review documentation, participate in the governance, help to validate and build the chain and its applications.
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>Who are cyber~FundClassic? </summary>
It is the future fund to be created and to help applications grow within the cyber ecosystem, with the help of cyber~Congress and cyber~Foundation. 
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>What is cyb~Virus? </summary>
The virus is a chrome extension (in the future this may apply to other web2 browsers). Its idea is to demonstrate the ability of cyber to download, save and rank any content from web2 to web3. We use chrome because we like irony. The idea to fuck google right in google's playground fascinates us.
  </details>

   <details>
  <summary>What is the brain? </summary>
The brain is the explorer of cyber. It shows transactions and statistics.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>What is gravity? </summary>
Gravity is a librabry that contains the visual components of cyb.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>Whats Chaingear? </summary>
Chaingear is one of our secret weapons. It is not yet fully described by us. But in its essence, it is an ETH based ability for anyone to create a personal or a public database with the help of NFT tokens. For example, one may create the database .porn and then create records in that database. I.E. world.porn, and yes, it works just like a domain-based structure. But it's not a domain-based structure, as it allows you to create other types of databases too.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>What are crawlers? </summary>
Crawlers will become tools that help masters and builders of the Great Web to migrate knowledge from web 2 to the new metaverse.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>Who is cyber~Admin </summary>
cyber~Admin is an intelligent bot that helps the cyber~Cogress team to work. In fact, he is a full member of the team.
  </details>

### cyber~Ecosystem
The cyber~Ecosystem is a subdivision of the metagalaxy. The ecosystem division is working towards a common goal: to build a better and a unique new web: `The Great Web`.

The coordination of efforts include:
- helping to create a validator pool
- helping to build communities
- connecting teams
- helping R&D
- cross-promote products and protocols
- provide strategic grants in the future
- creating and taking part in governance proposals
- VC and partnerships
- creating useful and unique documentation
- working towards a common goal

To get familiar with the cyber~Cosystem, we strongly suggest you read the [ecoystem development paper](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md), which includes a view on the development of cyber ~Ecosystem, describe what it is, its goals, values and participants. It should also offer theoretical and practical metrics that can measure the success of the proposed building blocks that will form the growth of the ecosystem. 

Full information about the ecosystem can be found in [the transparency folder](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/tree/master/ecosystem) of the congress repository.

#### Community
The work of the ecosystem is made out of various blocks, including:
- [Community work](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md#community-work): One of the main goals is to form a community of scientists, geeks, researches, validators, hackers, web3 agents and users as such (of any other possible category) for Cyber. The goal is to target all of [the relevant communites](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues/289), by which we mean a spectre of modern and efficient computers and their communities, rather than the foundations or organizations standing behind those projects
- [Cyberc-n](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md#cyberc0n): cyber~Congress has already organised one [self-governing event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfG_mn6psRQ&list=PL-MRS5fkWajCmfAS1WxBVgtMdFPmS4WTZ). Its goal is to achieve a completely sovereign and a self-ruling entity, that humans can help to run
- [Friendly aliens and partenrships](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md#friendly-aliens-and-partenrships):  We need to form strategic partnerships. We believe that developing Cyber means developing computing, rather than developing foundations behind those computers. This means that we will, first of all, look for similar values with our future allies
- [Governance and proposals](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md#governance-and-proposals): This means community governance for pretty much everything. Building applications, developing the protocol, onboarding projects, etc
- [Hacking and open-source](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md#hacking-and-open-source): If there is one thing that we believe in more than all else, it is probably open-source. Hence, we understand the value of building a community of open-source contributors
- [Research and R&D](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md#research-and-rd): We want to prove that our vision of the [Evolution of spicies](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/README.md) can and will uphold. All this requires research. A lot of research. Open-source, funded research that will benefit, not just Cyber, but will benefit the world.
- [VC](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md#vc): All this requires funds. As much as we would love for all to simply help us, distribute our tokens and let the beast live - we are aware that we are leaving in a world spun by money, which in itself isn't bad. Money is simply a communication protocol, alas - one that is broken
- [cyber~FundClassic](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md#cyberfundclassic): This fund will be funded out of the personal bag of cyber~Congress and its team members that wish to fund it. However, we believe that a further option of having community members also help to fund should remain open. The idea of the fund is to help buidl applications on top of the protocol
-[The important generation](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md#the-important-generation): We have stated on many occasions that we must concentrate on younger generations, not simply because they are the users and the engineers of tomorrow. That is, of course - one reason. But the reality is that the young (and the coming) generation has a completely different recognition of what we do. And that is a good thing

#### Communication flow & Blog
We believe that communication is uber important, hence we define a [communciation proccess](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/teams/communication%20and%20publishing.md) in which we describe the importance of communicating via [cyber~Blog](https://cybercongress.ai/post/) to the [relevant communities](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues/289).

cyber~Congress strongly values the importance of reports, we describe our flow of reporting in [this document](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/teams/team%20reports.md).

We also communicate via other arteries described below:

#### Congress website & cyber.page
The main gateway to cyber is, of course, [cyber.page](https://cyber.page/), an interface reference to the whole protocol. This is our main landing and targeting page. A road to Rome. Here you will find everything you need to know in order to use cyber. 

We also have a [website](http://cybercongress.ai/) for the DAO behind the launch of cyber: cyber~Congress. On this website you can find information about our projects, some basic statistics and, most importantly [technical docuamnetation](https://cybercongress.ai/docs/cyberd/cyberd/) for cyber and cyb, the [forum](http://ai.cybercongress.ai/) and the [blog](https://cybercongress.ai/post). Via this website and our [GitHub](https://github.com/cybercongress) cyber ~Congress communicates with the outer world. 

#### GitHub
Of course, everything we do is 100% open-source. Hence GitHub. Our [GitHub](https://github.com/cybercongress) contains many useful repositories filled with love, code and documentation, including the document you are reading right now. 

If you are looking for releases, code sources, want to help us via an issue or a pull request, this is the place to be. Also, this is the quickest place to get an answer to any question you have to the cyber~Congress team.

- [Forklog hub](https://hub.forklog.com/companies/cyber/): Forklog hub for cyber

A list of economic profiles:
- [Stakingrewards](https://www.stakingrewards.com/asset/cyber): Calculate your rewards as a delegator or a validator 

##### Extra media profiles
2 more profiles are done by team members of cyber. They might not be about cyber directly, but they help us to grow cyber into a known product amongst the communities that we need t reach out to:

- [The great web journal](https://github.com/cybercongress/great-web): A journal about the Great Webm that will remain permanent, trustful and accessible
- [Citizen Cosmos podcast](https://soundcloud.com/user-311461939/citizen-comsos-episode-1-gavin-figment-networks-governance): A podcast about the Cosmos ecosystem and the masterminds that shape it

There is 1 other profile that we want to mention, in which Cyber is mentioned, practically, on a daily basis. [Cosmsos Today](https://twitter.com/adriana_kalpa), this is a series of daily tweets that are run by different community members in various languages and are translated from the English version

#### Gitcoin
We believe in progress. We value contribution. We believe that we need to learn to help one another. This is why we want to develop the [Gitcoin program](https://gitcoin.co/profile/cybercongress) inside of cyber. Every sprint we try to allocate a certain amount of ETH and distribute it between our team members to actively use gitcoin.

#### Cyberc-n
Off-line events allow communities to grow stronger. Hackathons and useful conferences can help to build-up new teams together, allow form fabulous new creations. A perfect example of how awesome events shape the world was DEVCON-0, but we believe we can do much better.

cyber~Congress ha already organised one [self-governing event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfG_mn6psRQ&list=PL-MRS5fkWajCmfAS1WxBVgtMdFPmS4WTZ). To our knowledge, it was the first world conference to be run by a smart contract. We think that this is how it should be. And just as others, we learn our lessons.

In our plans for the coming year, to organise Cyberc1n. It will be a completely sovereign and a self-ruling entity, that humans can help to run. No more boring and long speeches. We plan entirely new formats, with whiteboards, geeks and ~blakc-jack~ coding.

#### Evangelists
The idea of an evangelist is to preach about cyber. To bootstrap this we created the Open Bootstrap Evangelism Program (OBEP), which after the bootstrap will, hopefully, carry on thanks to governance commitments and the community pool.

_Mission:_ Increase initial traction. Build strong local and/or online community
_Tooling:_ cyber tools that help. Creativity
_General Tasks:_ Translations. Creations of chats. Groups. Meetups. DR (donation relations). Governance. Hackathons. Etc

For this cyber~Congress has allocated a community pool and set out guidelines, during the bootstrap. Details can [be found here](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues/307). For us this is a long term relationship, so, we will create a distributed Evangelist network, that will be funded in CYB tokens from the ecosystem ~Fund via governance. 

#### Meetups & Hackathons
One of the main goals for cyber~Congress and the evangelist team will be to create useful and meaningful meetups, where people will onboard to cyber. This can be enhanced by Hackathons and other offline initiatives from the community.

#### Partnering communities
There are many importnat communities that cyber sees as vital for the success of building `the Great Web`. The idea behind publishing these, is that you may copy this list or print it out and help cyber to get more traction within these communitites.

### Launch process
As of writing this document, cyber is still in public testing. The current public, incentivized testnet is `euler-5`, it is also the chain-id.

The launch of cyber considers many different aspects, and we believe that to grasp cyber fully, one must also be familiar with the launch process. This is also a move to cement the launch process as a transparent event.

In this section, we will concentrate on the period of post-euler-5 and up to the end of cyber~Auction, which ends 500 days after the launch of the mainnet. However, the full process is described below.

#### Full launch roadmap

- 2020, and for a period of 21 days after the launch of the mainnet: Game of Thrones
- 2020 - 2021, after Game of Thrones: cyber~Auction, which lasts for 479 days

If you are interested in the development roadmap, please see the [projects roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/cybercongress/projects/2). It is broken into episodes. Each episode contains the main current tasks. Each task may contain multiple intenral tasks, which in turn live in their own repositories. Episodes do not have a specified timeline.

#### Distribution games introduction
The distribution games are a way of improving the distribution of tokens to a higher number of participants in a fairer way through a gamified process. There are 3 distribution games proposed in total. Their goal is to help increase the initial efficiency of the distribution.

**Q:** What is Game of Links (GoL)?<br>
**A:** The name is partially self-explanatory here. The idea is to distribute tokens based on several parameters (disciplines within the game). Those include not just linking but some other technical things. The simple idea behind this is to make the protocol better at the start and to make sure tokens are distributed to those who are interested most in the success of the idea (initial believers).

**Q:** What is Game of Thrones (GoT)? <br>
**A:** It's a game where one community of hodlers tries to outbid the other in return for receiving a larger discount. 10% of CYB supply is allocated per each competing community. 100 TCYB to the ATOM community for donating ATOM. And an equivalent amount to the ETH community, which will initially receive THC tokens that they can lock during the auction in exchange for CYB tokens (in other words the ETH donators can potentially receive both THC and CYB tokens). The game will last for 21 days.

**Q:** What is cyber~Auction?<br>
**A:** cyber ~Auction is part of the initial distribution games. If the first two focus on specific target groups (although anyone is free to participate). The goal of cyber ~Auction is to focus on all types of users. It will take place after the end of the previous games.

The auction will last for 500 rounds that last for 23 hours each (a little over 479 days). Every round has 1 billion THC is at skate. The more you donate and the less has been donated by others on that same day the more you can gain. After the end of the distribution, participants will be able to unlock their THC tokens and use them as they wish, e.i. transfer, trade, etc. As a result of the auction, the community will have access to all the donated ETH within the Aragon organization.

One more mega important part of the auction to remember, are the creative powers of THC. If you vest your THC tokens for the period of the auction - you receive 1 CYB token for each locked THC token for the duration of the auction!

*(Hint: A thorough guide on the games is in the beep, beep, beep section) 

#### The launch protocol and initial GoL details
For the slightly technically advanced users, there is a [laucnh-kit repository](https://github.com/cybercongress/launch-kit) that can take you through each part of the Genesis launch protocol. Here, we will concentrate on the main parts of it.

Here is the full visualization of the launch protocol:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/mDcz3JRV/launch-protocol-v2.png" />

And, here you can see the details of the launch process from euler-5, to the end of Game of Thrones:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/QN9nR8hm/timeline.png" />

#### Laucnh FAQ

  <details>
  <summary>Why the procedure is so complex? </summary>
 It isn't. It might seem like this to the naked eye. The reasons behind it are the desire to separate each detail of the protocol and work on it thoroughly, to use all of the experience that our team has and not to repeat the mistakes of other projects.
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>Can you describe the launch process in a paragraph? </summary>
From 2016-2019 we were working on researching, developing and publicly testing the protocol. At the end of 2019, we launched the first leg of the distribution games, made to increase initial traction, test the protocol and achieve good distribution. The first part is the Game of Links, which is an incentivized game with different technical disciplines and a public donation round in ATOMs to the cyber~Congress DAO. The second parts are made out of Game of Thornes, the game between ETH and ATOM communities to outbid each other and get more tokens from cyber~Congress, and cyber ~Auction, the 479-day long auction, in equal windows with public ETH donations to the community DAO governing the protocol. GoT is window 0 of the auction. The auction takes part after the launch of the mainnet.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>How to get involved at this stage? </summary>
Play the Game of Links. launch a validator. Submit links to the knowledge graph. Helps us to get traction. Become an evangelist. Help us to test the governance, etc.
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>Do you have a White Paper? </summary>
Yes, it can be found via this IPFS link: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPjbx76LycfzSSWMcnni6YVvV3UNhTrYzyPMuiA9UQM3x
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>When are you launching a stable mainnet? </summary>
The network will launch when Game of Links is done (the other 2 games are held after the launch) and its final is over. There are 146 active validators and all the tokens are distributed. As of the end of 2019, the ETA is summer 2020. We strongly encourage participation when GoL kicks-off!
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>Who are the people behind the project? </summary>
We are a team of geeks, enthusiasts, thinkers, hackers and people who firmly believe in what they want to achieve. If you wish to, you can skim through our GitHub and easily find links to some of our public profiles (like keybase) and much more information about each one of us. All of us can be reached here or on our forums.
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>How do I contact you? </summary>
Via our GitHub, via our forum or our TG chat. All links are at the end of this document. 
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary> So, How do I use it?</summary>
Please see the Using cyber: the very basics section for this.
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>What is the fastest way to get tokens? </summary>
Play the Game of course! Another quick way is to use future faucets or Kira's TG bot, which you can find on our TG channel.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>How many tokens do I need to start using cyber? </summary>
There isn't a specific amount of tokens you need to use the network. This is a very dynamic property. The current statistics can be viewed on cyber.page. It should be noted that all transactions require bandwidth (resources). However, transactions don't spend your tokens. The tokens "freeze" for some time, after which, they are released back to the user. This is a spam protection mechanism.
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>Can I contribute? </summary>
Other than in the ways described in the section about how to get involved, you may also try to solve issues, submit PRs or help us with research. 
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>Will I be rewarded for my contributions? </summary>
There are several ways someone can get rewarded:
We actively use GitCoin. This means that we fund some of our tasks and issues. If you are an open-source developer, you can solve issues and get rewarded.
We constantly announce grants for open-source development and research. For example our Urbit open-source proposal
You can gain social weight and social reputation by becoming an early adopter (please make conclusions for yourself, as to what this might gain).
If you run a validator node, you are entitled to receive rewards that are described above.
You can take advantage of the community pool.
You can be a part of the OBEP. 
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>Is this an ICO? </summary>
The projects receive donations from users who wish to donate them and participate in the distribution games. The process can be referred to as an initial community offering. Which is the process where the community understands the value of the proposed idea and decides to donate towards its development for its own benefit.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>Why do you need donations? </summary>
Thanks to ATOM donations we want to secure a commitment for cyber~Congress in the development of both: Cosmos and Cyber ecosystems. ATOM donations will allow for cyber ~Congress to use staking rewards for continuous funding of the protocol without the necessity to dump tokens.
THC donations will be managed by an Aragon DAO (the community) to help develop the protocol in the longterm.
  </details>

## :nut_and_bolt: Section subtitle: Mama I'm an engineer
By now you should be somewhat familiar with what cyber is and its basics. In this section, we will learn to be engineers. At first, this section was meant to be part of the technical guides and the deep space section. But validating cyber is of uber importance, hence, before we move on, let's see how you can become amongst the first to validate `The Great Web` and earn rewards.

### Validating cyber
#### A cheat code
You may skip through this and jump straight to the [onboarding guide](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/validators/onboarding.md) for validators, which contains all of the links to mos of the information described below.

#### Questions and answers
**Q:** How do I become a validator in Cyber? <br>
**A:** Make sure you have the requirements described in this document and follow this guide

**Q:** What do I need to become a validator in Cyber? <br>
**A:** Anyone can become a validator if he has the right hardware to run it. Right now, the requirements are as following:
- CPU: 4 cores (6 is better)
- RAM: 16 GB (64 would be better)
- SSD: 256 GB (512 is preferred)
- Connection: 100 Mbit fiber
- GPU: CUDA / GeForce 1070/80
- Software: Linux, Docker

**Q:** Do I need to become a validator?<br>
**A:** It is only up for you to decide if you do. As a validator, you will be entitled to receive rewards out of the inflation for committing your hardware.

**Q:** What are the incentives for becoming a validator?<br>
**A:** You can earn rewards and help to bootstrap the network by running a validator node. Apart from that:
- You can use your cards to take part in computing the knowledge graph and be a part of an interesting project
- You will be receiving rewards for running a validator, just like in Cosmos (ATOM)

#### Become a hero: launch a node
We call validators `Heroes`, this is because they are. They are the heroes that can help to set, run and maintain the right, distributed, open-source, desired infrastructure needed for `The Great Web`. To become a hero, follow the below guide.

##### Supported GPU list for cyberd validators
Within `cyber protocol` the proof of relevance root hash is computed on CUDA GPUs every round as the most efficient way to calculate merkle tree. We need to load the whole graph in the memory for calculations. This is why memory volume is important. Currently, with `~2,5 M` links, the memory of the GPU is loaded to `150 Mb`. This means that 1 link is 60 bytes of GPU memory. A GPU with 6Gb memory can calculate a graph with 100 Mil links. Under the load of the network with 10 Mil links per day, this GPU will reach its limit in 10 days.

**Note** The current active testnet is `euler-6` (substitute <testnet_chain_id> with that value, do not forget to remove the `<` and the `>` symbols).

##### Prepare your server
First of all, you should set up a server.
Your node should be running (online) constantly. This means that you will need a reliable server to keep it running.
You may also consider using any cloud service with a dedicated GPU, like Hetzner (or use a local machine). Whatever you'll choose, for better stability and consistency we recommend to use a dedicated server for each separate validator node.

Cyberd is based on Cosmos-SDK and is written in Go.
It should work on any platform which can compile and run programs in Go.
However, we strongly recommend running the validator node on a Linux-based server.

The rank calculations are done via GPU computations.
They are easy to parallelize. This is why we recommended using a GPU.

Recommended requirements:

```js
CPU: 6 cores
RAM: 32 GB
SSD: 256 GB
Connection: 100Mb, Fiber, Stable and low-latency connection
GPU: Nvidia GeForce(or Tesla/Titan/Quadro) with CUDA-cores; at least 6gb of memory*
Software: Docker, Ubuntu 16.04/18.04 LTS
```

*Cyberd runs well on consumer-grade cards like Geforce GTX 1070, but expect load growth. We advise to use Error Correction compatible cards from Tesla or Quadro families.*

But, of course, the hardware is your own choice and technically it might be possible to run the chain on "even - 1 CUDA core GPU", but, you should be aware of stability and a decline in calculation speed.

##### Third-party software

To access the GPU, cyberd uses Nvidia drivers version **410+** and the [Nvidia CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) should be installed on the hosting system. 

You may skip any sections of the guide if you already have any of the necessary software configured. 

As long as the current implementation of `cyber` is written in [Go](https://golang.org/), you will need to install Go.

##### Installing Go

For `euler-6` Cyberd requires at least Go version 1.13+. Install it according to the official [guide](https://golang.org/doc/install):

1. Download the archive:

```bash
wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.9.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

2. Extract it into `/usr/local`, creating a Go tree in `/usr/local/go`:

```bash
tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.13.9.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

3. Add `/usr/local/go/bin` to the PATH environment variable. You can do this by adding this line to your `/etc/profile` (for installation on the whole system) or `$HOME/.profile`:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```

4. Do `source` for the file with your `$PATH` variable or just log-out/log-in:

```bash
source /etc/profile
```

or

```bash
source $HOME/.profile
```

5. To check your installation run

```bash
`go version`
```

This will let you know if everything was installed correctly. As an output, you should see the following (version number may vary, of course):

```bash
go version go1.13.8 linux/amd64
```

##### Installing Nvidia drivers 
1. To proceed, first, add the `ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa` repository into your system (you might see some warnings - press `enter`):

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
```

```bash
sudo apt update
```

2. Install Ubuntu-drivers:

```bash
sudo apt install -y ubuntu-drivers-common
```

3. Next, identify your graphic card model and the recommended drivers:

```bash
ubuntu-drivers devices
```

You should see something similar to this:

```bash
== /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/0000:01:00.0 ==
modalias : pci:v000010DEd00001BA1sv00001462sd000011E4bc03sc00i00
vendor   : NVIDIA Corporation
model    : GP104M [GeForce GTX 1070 Mobile]
driver   : nvidia-driver-418 - third-party free
driver   : nvidia-driver-410 - third-party free
driver   : nvidia-driver-430 - third-party free
driver   : nvidia-driver-440 - third-party free recommended
driver   : xserver-xorg-video-nouveau - distro free builtin
```

4. We need the **410+** drivers release. As you can see that v440 is recommended. The command below will install the recommended version of the drivers:

```bash
sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall
```

The driver installation takes approximately 10 minutes.

```bash

```

5. Reboot the system for the changes to take effect.

6. Check the installed drivers:

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

You should see this:
(Some version/driver numbers might differ. You might also have some processes already running)

```bash
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

```

##### Installing CUDA toolkit
Simply run:

```bash
apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit
```

Any version above 9.1 is OK. To check the version run: `

```bash
nvcc --version
```

The possible output will look like this:

```bash
nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver
Copyright (c) 2005-2017 NVIDIA Corporation
Built on Fri_Nov__3_21:07:56_CDT_2017
Cuda compilation tools, release 9.1, V9.1.85
```

##### Launching Cyberd fullnode
1. Add environment variables:

```bash
export DAEMON_HOME=$HOME/.cyberd
export DAEMON_NAME=cyber
```

To make those variables persistent add them to the end of the **`$HOME/.profile`** and log-out/log-in, or do:

```bash
source ~/.profile
```

2. Make a directories tree for storing your daemon:

```bash
mkdir $HOME/.cyberd
mkdir -p $DAEMON_HOME/upgrade_manager
mkdir -p $DAEMON_HOME/upgrade_manager/genesis
mkdir -p $DAEMON_HOME/upgrade_manager/genesis/bin
```

3. Download cosmosd repo and build cosmosd:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/regen-network/cosmosd
cd cosmosd
go build
mv cosmosd $DAEMON_HOME/
chmod +x $DAEMON_HOME/cosmosd
```

4. Clone the go-cyber repo, checkout to the necessary version (`master` by default):

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/cybercongress/go-cyber
```

5. Build cyber~Rank CUDA kernel:

```bash
cd ~/go-cyber/x/rank/cuda/
make
```

5. Build cyber daemon (as a result you should see `cyberd` and `cyberdcli` files inside of the `go-cyber/build/` folder):

```bash
cd ~/go-cyber
make build
```

6. Copy the binaries to an apropriate locations:

```bash
cp build/cyberd $DAEMON_HOME/upgrade_manager/genesis/bin
cp build/cyberdcli /usr/local/bin/
cp build/cyberd /usr/local/bin/
```

7. Initialize cyber daemon:

```bash
cd $DAEMON_HOME/upgrade_manager/genesis/bin
./cyberd init <your_node_moniker> --home $DAEMON_HOME
```

8. Your folder with cyberd must look like this after initialization:

```bash
root@node:~/.cyberd# tree
.
├── config
│   ├── app.toml
│   ├── config.toml
│   ├── node_key.json
│   └── priv_validator_key.json
├── cosmosd
├── data
│   └── priv_validator_state.json
└── upgrade_manager
    └── genesis
        └── bin
            └── cyberd
```

As a result of this operation, the `data` and `config` folders should appear inside of your *$DAEMON_HOME/* folder.

8. Download `genesis.json` and place into your `.cyberd/config`:

```bash
cd $DAEMON_HOME/config
wget -O genesis.json https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZHpLc3H5RMXp3Z4LURNpKgNfXd3NZ8pZLYbjNFPL6T5n
```

9. Setup private peers in `config.toml`. You can find them on our [forum](https://ai.cybercongress.ai/t/euler-6-testnet-faq/65).

##### Setup cyberd as a service (Ubuntu)
1. Increase resource limits for [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com):

```bash
ulimit -n 4096
```

2. Make cyberd a system service. This will help you easily start/stop cyberd and run it in the background:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/cyberd.service
```

Paste the following (replace `ubuntu` with your username, or if you running as `root` replce the whole */home/ubuntu/* to `/root/`):

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Cyber Node
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=ubuntu
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/.cyberd/
ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/.cyberd/cosmosd start --compute-rank-on-gpu=true
Environment=DAEMON_HOME=/home/ubuntu/.cyberd
Environment=DAEMON_NAME=cyberd
Environment=GAIA_HOME=/home/ubuntu/.cyberd
Restart=always
RestartSec=3m
LimitNOFILE=4096

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

If you need to enable search of the node add the flag `--allow-search=true` right after `--compute-rank-on-gpu=true`. If you need to run a rest-server alongside `cberd` here is a service file for it (do `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/cyberdcli-rest.service` and paste the following), just make sure you'll replace `ubuntu` to your user name and group:

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Cyberdcli REST Server

[Service]
User=ubuntu
Group=ubuntu
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/cyberdcli rest-server --laddr tcp://0.0.0.0:1317 --chain-id euler-6
Restart=always
TimeoutSec=120
RestartSec=30

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

There's a possibility to build and run swagger-ui for your node to get a better experience with the rest-server. To get it up you'll have to install `static` library for Go: 

```bash
go get github.com/rakyll/statik
```

Then `cd` to the go-cyber repo and set static file for swagger-ui:

```bash
cd <path_to_go-cyber>/go-cyber/
statik -src=cmd/cyberdcli/temp -dest=cmd/cyberdcli/lcd -f
```

Rebuild cyberdcli and replace the one in `/usr/local/bin` (no worries, you won't lose your keys, if you already have keys imported):

```bash
make build
cp build/cyberdcli /usr/local/bin/
```

When all of the above steps are completed and cyberdcli-rest service has been started, you should have Swagger-ui available at `http://localhost:1317/swagger-ui/` .

3. Run cyberd:

Reload `systemd` after the creation of the new service:

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
```

Start the node:

```bash
sudo systemctl start cyberd
```

Check node status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status cyberd
```

Enable service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable cyberd
```

Check logs:

```bash
journalctl -u cyberd -f --lines 50
```

If you need to stop the node:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop cyberd
```

All commands in this section are also applicable to `cyberdcli-rest.service`.

At this point your cyberd should be running in the backgroud and you should be able to call `cyberdcli` to operate with the client. Try calling `cyberdcli status`. A possible output looks like this:

```bash
{"node_info":{"protocol_version":{"p2p":"6","block":"9","app":"0"},"id":"93b776d3eb3f3ce9d9bda7164bc8af3acacff7b6","listen_addr":"tcp://0.0.0.0:26656","network":"euler-6","version":"0.32.7","channels":"4020212223303800","moniker":"anon","other":{"tx_index":"on","rpc_address":"tcp://0.0.0.0:26657"}},"sync_info":{"latest_block_hash":"686B4E65415D4E56D3B406153C965C0897D0CE27004E9CABF65064B6A0ED4240","latest_app_hash":"0A1F6D260945FD6E926785F07D41049B8060C60A132F5BA49DD54F7B1C5B2522","latest_block_height":"4553","latest_block_time":"2019-11-24T09:49:19.771375108Z","catching_up":false},"validator_info":{"address":"66098853CF3B61C4313DD487BA21EDF8DECACDF0","pub_key":{"type":"tendermint/PubKeyEd25519","value":"uZrCCdZTJoHE1/v+EvhtZufJgA3zAm1bN4uZA3RyvoY="},"voting_power":"0"}}
```

Your node has started to sync. If that didn't happen, check your config.toml file located at `$DAEMON_HOME/config/config.toml` and add at least a couple of addresses to <persistent_peers = ""> and <seeds = "">, some of those you can find on our [forum](https://ai.cybercongress.ai/).

Additional information about the chain is available via an API endpoint at: `localhost:26657` (access via your browser)

E.G. the number of active validators is available at: `localhost:26657/validators`

4. If your node did not launch correctly from the genesis, you need to set the current link to cosmosd for cyber daemon:

```bash
ln -s $DAEMON_HOME/upgrade_manager/genesis current
```

If you joined the testnet **after** a chain upgrade happened, you must point your current link to a new location (with an approptiatly upgraded binary file):

```bash
mkdir $DAEMON_HOME/upgrade_manager/upgrades
cp <path_to_upgraded_cyberd> $DAEMON_HOME/upgrade_manager/upgrades
ln -s $DAEMON_HOME/upgrade_manager/upgrades current
```

After your node has successfully synced, you can run a validator.

##### Prepare a staking address
We included 1 million Ethereum addresses, over 10000 Cosmos addresses and all of `euler-4` validators addresses into the genesis file. This means that there's a huge chance that you already have some EUL tokens. Here are 3 ways to check this:

If you already have a cyberd address with EUL and know the seed phrase or your private key, just restore it into your local Keystore:

```bash
cyberdcli keys add <your_key_name> --recover
cyberdcli keys show <your_key_name>
```

If you have an Ethereum address that had ~0.2Eth or more at block 8080808 (on the ETH network), you probably received a gift and may import your Ethereum private key. To check your gift balance, paste your Ethereum address on [cyber.page](https://cyber.page).

> Please do not import high-value Ethereum accounts. This is not safe! cyberd software is new and has not been audited yet.

```bash
cyberdcli keys add private <your_key_name>
cyberdcli keys show <your_key_name>
```

If you want to create a new account, use the command below:
(You should send coins to that address to bound them later during the launch of the validator)

```bash
cyberdcli keys add <your_key_name>
cyberdcli keys show <your_key_name>
```

You could use your Ledger device, with the Cosmos app installed on it to sign and store cyber addresses: [guide here](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberd/blob/0.1.5/docs/cyberd_Ledger_guide.md).
In most cases use the --ledger flag, with your commands:

```bash
cyberdcli keys add <your_key_name> --ledger
```

**<your_key_name>** is any name you pick to represent this key pair.
You have to refer to this parameter <your_key_name> later when you use the keys to sign transactions.
It will ask you to enter your password twice to encrypt the key.
You will also need to enter your password when you use your key to sign any transaction.

The command returns the address, a public key and a seed phrase, which you can use to
recover your account if you forget your password later.
Keep the seed phrase at a safe place (not in hot storage) in case you have to use it.

The address shown here is your account address. Let’s call this **<your_account_address>**.
It stores your assets.

**Important note**: Starting with v.38 cosmos-SDK uses os-native keyring to store all your keys. We've noticed that in certain cases it does not work well by default (for example if you don't have any GUI installed on your machine). If during the execution of the `cyberdcli keys add` command, you are getting this type of error:

```bash

You will have to use another keyring backend to keep your keys. Here are 2 options: store the files within the cli folder or a `pass` manager.

Setting keyring backend to a **local file**:

Execute:

```bash
cyberdcli config keyring-backend file
```

As a result you migth see following: `configuration saved to /root/.cybercli/config/config.toml`

Execute:

```bash
cyberdcli config --get keyring-backend
```

The result should be the following:

```bash
user@node:~# cyberdcli config --get keyring-backend
file
```

This means that you've set your keyring-backend to a local file. *Note*, in this case, all the keys in your keyring will be encrypted using the same password. If you would like to set up a unique password for each key, you should set a unique `--home` folder for each key. To do that, just use `--home=/<unique_path_to_key_folder>/` with setup keyring backend and at all interactions with keys when using cyberdcli:

```bash
cyberdcli config keyring-backend file --home=/<unique_path_to_key_folder>/
cyberdcli keys add <your_second_key_name> --home=/<unique_path_to_key_folder>/
cyberdcli keys list --home=/<unique_path_to_key_folder>/
```

Set keyring backend to [**pass manager**](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/9cce836c08d14dc6836d07164dd964b2b7226f36/crypto/keyring/doc.go#L30):

Pass utility uses a GPG key to encrypt your keys (but again, it uses the same GPG for all the keys). To install and generate your GPG key you should follow [this guide](https://www.passwordstore.org/) or this very [detailed guide](http://tuxlabs.com/?p=450). When you'll get your `pass` set, configure `cyberdcli` to use it as a keyring backend:

```bash
cyberdcli config keyring-backend pass
```

And verify that all has been set as planned:

```bash
cyberdcli config --get keyring-backend
pass
```

##### Send the create validator transaction
Validators are actors on the network committing to new blocks by submitting their votes.
This refers to the node itself, not a single person or a single account.
Therefore, the public key here is referring to the nodes public key,
not the public key of the address you have just created.

To get the nodes public key run the following command:

```bash
cyberd tendermint show-validator
```

It will return a bech32 public key. Let’s call it **<your_node_pubkey>**.
The next step is to declare a validator candidate.
The validator candidate is the account which stakes the coins.
So the validator candidate is the account this time.
To declare a validator candidate, run the following command adjusting the staked amount and the other fields:

```bash
cyberdcli tx staking create-validator \
  --amount=10000000eul \
  --min-self-delegation "1000000" \
  --pubkey=<your_node_pubkey> \
  --moniker=<your_node_nickname> \
  --trust-node \
  --from=<your_key_name> \
  --commission-rate="0.10" \
  --commission-max-rate="0.20" \
  --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
  --chain-id=euler-6
```

##### Verify that you are validating

```bash
cyberdcli query staking validators --trust-node=true
```

If you see your `<your_node_nickname>` with status `Bonded` and Jailed `false`, everything is good.
You are validating the network.

#### A video guide 
Please note, that the video is somewhat outdated, hence use it as reference only, followed up by these guides!

We have an awesome video guide that will help you to set-up your infrastructure. It contains additional details and addons for the above guide, make sure to watch it:

[![Validating video guide](https://i.postimg.cc/KjyBtBcz/Screenshot-from-2020-02-18-18-47-25.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMUatLPfNJM&t=1747s)

#### Maintenance of the validator
##### Jailing

If your validator got slashed, it will get jailed.
If it happens the operator must unjail the validator manually:

```bash
cyberdcli tx slashing unjail --from=<your_key_name> --chain-id euler-5
```

#### Setup config.toml
Correct configuration is one of the main keys to consistent and proper functioning of your node no matter if it is a validator or a sentinel/service node.

Throughout this document, we will check all the key points of the `config.toml` file and explain how to configure them for all use-cases.

We will operate a basic configuration file (according to the number of the line in the actual file), generated after the initialization of cyber daemon and typically located inside `$HOME/.cyberd/config directory`.

> All changes made to the `config.toml` file, require to restart cyberd to take effect!

##### Port / Address configuration

###### RPC port:

First of all, let's look through the ports cyberd uses to communicate with the outside world. On *line 84* the specified port is used for an RPC server (TCP and UNIX websocket connections):

```bash
# TCP or UNIX socket address for the RPC server to listen on
laddr = "tcp://127.0.0.1:26657"
```

After the node starts the RPC server provides endpoints to check chain/node parameters, accepts $POST transactions and so on. It can be opened locally using your favourite browser via: `http://localhost:26657`.

- We do not recommend a validator node to open this port to the outside world, as it may allow anyone to produce transactions using your node and allows DOS attacks (you don't want your validator attacked, right?). So let's leave it like this:

```bash
laddr = "tcp://127.0.0.1:26657"
```

- For Sentinel nodes this should be kept the same as for validators:

```bash
laddr = "tcp://127.0.0.1:26657"
```

- For Service nodes, when use cases include remote access to the RPC for yourself or for your great service, it is allowable to expose it to the outside by using the following values:

```bash
laddr = "tcp://0.0.0.0:26657"
```

If you would like to make the RPC server respond on a different port, you may change this value to whatever you'd like (just make sure it will not cross with any of the other services), for example, to change it to `9588` use:

```bash
# TCP or UNIX socket address for the RPC server to listen on
laddr = "tcp://0.0.0.0:9588"
```

###### Cyberd communication port:

On *line 163* we can find the following:

```bash
# Address to listen for incoming connections
laddr = "tcp://0.0.0.0:26656"
```

This is the way the node communicates with other nodes in the chain. For all possible cases(**Validator, Sentinel, Service**) leave it as default, bound to  `0.0.0.0`. And if you need to change the port number to something different like `35622` just use:

```bash
laddr = "tcp://0.0.0.0:35622"
```

If changed, your node peer address would be changed accordingly: `75e8f44072b0dd598dfa95aaf9b5f2c60f956819@your_external_ip:35622`.

###### Prometheus collectors port
On *line 325* the port for Prometheus monitoring service is located: 

```bash
# Address to listen for Prometheus collector(s) connections
prometheus_listen_addr = ":26660"
```

It is useful if you want to monitor remotely the condition of your node using the [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics collector service and could be changed to whatever you like `23456`:

```bash
prometheus_listen_addr = ":23456"
```

Don't forget to enable Prometheus metrics by changing to `true` on *line 322*, if needed:

```bash
# When true, Prometheus metrics are served under /metrics on
# PrometheusListenAddr.
# Check out the documentation for the list of available metrics.
prometheus = true
```

###### External address
On *line 169* you should find the following:

```bash
# Address to advertise to peers for them to dial
# If empty, will use the same port as the laddr,
# and will introspect on the listener or use UPnP
# to figure out the address.
external_address = ""
```

This line implies specifying your external IP address, which means the presence of a static external address at your network connection. If you don't have one, just skip it.

- For Validator nodes, you may skip it, until you have **enough private peers** to get synced with. Otherwise, you have to specify your external static IP to improve peer discovery for your node. Also, don't forget to change the port according to *line [163](#cyberd-communication-port)*:

```bash
external_address = "tcp://<your_external_static_ip>:26656"
```

- For Sentinel nodes it is a good idea to specify the IP for better peer discovery:

```bash
external_address = "tcp://<your_external_static_ip>:26656"
```

- For Servie nodes this setting can be the same as for Sentinel nodes:

```bash
external_address = "tcp://<your_external_static_ip>:26656"
```

And again, all of the above settings apply to the cases when **STATIC EXTERNAL IP** is available.

###### Allowing duplicate IP's
*Line 224* of the config.toml holds the following:

```bash
# Toggle to disable guard against peers connecting from the same ip.
allow_duplicate_ip = false
```

This variable configures the possibility for different peers to be connected from the same IP. Lets imagine a situation where you run 2 nodes (lets say that the node ID of the first one is: `75e8f44072b0dd598dfa95aaf9b5f2c60f956819` and the second one is: `d0518ce9881a4b0c5872e5e9b7c4ea8d760dad3f`) on one internet provider, with an external IP of 92.23.45.123. In this case, all other nodes in the network with `allow_duplicate_ip = false` will see attempts to connect from peers `d0518ce9881a4b0c5872e5e9b7c4ea8d760dad3f@92.23.45.123:26656` and `75e8f44072b0dd598dfa95aaf9b5f2c60f956819@92.23.45.123:36656` and will block the one which comes last because the originating IP address is the same for both nodes. If this case applies to you, change this setting to the following:

```bash
# Toggle to disable guard against peers connecting from the same ip.
allow_duplicate_ip = true
```

##### P2P configuration
###### Seed nodes:

On *line 172* of the config.toml we see the following:

```bash
# Comma separated list of seed nodes to connect to
seeds = ""
```

This line is dedicated to the list of seed nodes you want to establish a connection with. To get seed nodes addresses take a look at our [forum](https://ai.cybercongress.ai/) or ask on our [Telegram chat](https://t.me/fuckgoogle).

- For validators with sentinel nodes or with a decent quantity of peers connected it is not required to fill it out:

```bash
seeds = ""
```

- For Sentinel nodes and Service nodes it's a good idea to fill it out with a couple of seed node addresses, separated with commas: 

```bash
seeds = "<seed_node1_ID>@<seed_node1_ip>:<port>,<seed_node2_ID>@<seed_node2_ip>:<port>"
```

###### Persistent peers
The place to add persistent peers is located on *line 175.* Presence of persistent peers is very important for the correct functioning of the node:

```bash
# Comma separated list of nodes to keep persistent connections to
persistent_peers = ""
```

- For Validator nodes you have to fill out this line with a decent amount of peers you **trust**, otherwise, your validator node address will be exposed. In the perfect case scenario, you should add to this section only the addresses of your sentinel nodes:

```bash
persistent_peers ="<sentinel_node1_ID>@<sentinel_node1_ip>:<port>,<sentinel_node2_ID>@<sentinel_node2_ip>:<port>"
```

- For Sentinel nodes and Service nodes add as many peers as possible to keep a persistent connection and network stability, but **DO NOT** put here you'r validator nodes ID's:

```bash
persistent_peers ="<node1_ID>@<node1_ip>:<port>,<node2_ID>@<node2_ip>:<port>,...,<node_n_ID>@<node_n_ip>:<port>"
```

###### Peer Exchange Reactor
*Line 212* shows by default:

```bash
# Set true to enable the peer-exchange reactor
pex = true
```

This is a peer exchange module, which is responsible for exchanging node IDs across the network.

- For Validator nodes with Sentinel architecture set this to be disabled:

```bash
pex = false
```

- For Sentinel nodes and Service nodes leave as default:

```bash
pex = true
```

###### Private peers ID's
On *line 221* we see:

```bash
# Comma separated list of peer IDs to keep private (will not be gossiped to other peers)
private_peer_ids = ""
```

This is the list of peers which IDs should not gossip to others.

- For Validator nodes, leave as default:

```bash
private_peer_ids = ""
```

Or you may add your 2nd validator ID here (if you running more than 1 validator).

- For Sentinel nodes, add your validator/s address  here:

```bash
private_peer_ids = "<validator_node_ID>@<validator_node_ip>:<port>"
```

- For Service nodes leave blank:

```bash
private_peer_ids = ""
```

##### Node Index, Naming

###### Indexed tags:

A node can index and store a decent amount of keys and values with regards to transactions, accounts etc. *Lines 306 and 304* are responsible for this:

```bash
# You can also index transactions by height by adding "tx.height" key here.
#
# It's recommended to index only a subset of keys due to possible memory
# bloat. This is, of course, depends on the indexer's DB and the volume of
# transactions.
index_keys = ""

# When set to true, tells indexer to index all compositeKeys (predefined keys:
# "tx.hash", "tx.height" and all keys from DeliverTx responses).
#
# Note this may be not desirable (see the comment above). IndexKeys has a
# precedence over IndexAllKeys (i.e. when given both, IndexKeys will be
# indexed).
index_all_keys = false
```

- For Validator and Sentinel nodes this is not necessary, so leave as default: 

```bash
index_keys = ""

index_all_keys = false
```

- For Service nodes, you should specify a subset of keys you want to index:

```bash
index_keys = "tx.hash,tx.height,...etc.."

index_all_keys = all
```

###### Naming 

To setup up your node moniker please refer to *line 16* and type in whatever you want to have as moniker:

```bash
# A custom human readable name for this node
moniker = "god_damn_node"
```

#### CLI guide 
##### Install cyberd client
It is possible to interact with cyber even if you don't have your own node. All you need to do is install `cyberdcli` on your machine using the script below (just paste it in the console):

```bash
bash < <(curl -s https://mars.cybernode.ai/go-cyber/install_cyberdcli_v0.1.6.sh)
```

To start using the client without an own node, you have to configure some parameter Such as: [key storage](#keyring-manipulation-settings), [connetion to a remote node](#usefull-client-configuration), etc.

After installation you will be able to use `cyberdcli` to [import accounts](#account-management), create [links](#linking-content) or, for example, run a validator.

First of all, I would like to encourage you to use the  `--help` feature if you want to get a better experience of using cyberdcli. This is a really easy way to find all the necessary commands with the appropriate options and flags.

For example, you can enter:

```bash
cyberdcli --help
```

You should see this message:

```bash
Command line interface for interacting with cyberd

Usage:
cyberdcli [command]

Available Commands:
status      Query remote node for status
config      Create or query an application CLI configuration file
query       Querying subcommands
tx          Transactions subcommands

rest-server Start LCD (light-client daemon), a local REST server

keys        Add or view local private keys

version     Print the app version
link        Create and sign a link tx
help        Help about any command

Flags:
    --chain-id string   Chain ID of tendermint node
-e, --encoding string   Binary encoding (hex|b64|btc) (default "hex")
-h, --help              help for cyberdcli
    --home string       directory for config and data (default "/root/.cyberdcli")
-o, --output string     Output format (text|json) (default "text")
    --trace             print out full stack trace on errors
```

The help feature works like a pyramid, you can use it with any command to find available options, subcommands and flags. For example, lets explore the `query` subcommands:

```bash
cyberdcli query --help
```

You can see the structure of the subcommand:

```bash
Usage:
cyberdcli query [command]
```

And the available subcommands and flags:

```bash
Available Commands:
account                  Query account balance

tendermint-validator-set Get the full tendermint validator set at given height
block                    Get verified data for a the block at given height
txs                      Query for paginated transactions that match a set of tags
tx                       Query for a transaction by hash in a committed block

rank                     Querying commands for the rank module

Flags:
-h, --help   help for query

Global Flags:
    --chain-id string   Chain ID of tendermint node
-e, --encoding string   Binary encoding (hex|b64|btc) (default "hex")
    --home string       directory for config and data (default "/root/.cyberdcli")
-o, --output string     Output format (text|json) (default "text")
    --trace             print out full stack trace on errors
```

Let's explore the `account` subcommand:

```bash
cyberdcli query account --help
```

We can see all of the options available for this subcommands, namely, account address and flags:

```bash
Usage:
cyberdcli query account [address] [flags]
```

In most cases you will need just two extra flags:

```bash
--from <your_key_name> \
--chain-id euler-6
```

That's it. This is a very useful tool for using cyberdcli and troubleshooting.

#### Keyring manipulation settings

**Important note**: Starting with v.38, Cosmos-SDK uses os-native keyring to store all of your keys. We've noticed that in certain cases it does not work well by default (for example if you don't have any GUI installed on your machine). If during the execution `cyberdcli keys add` command, you are getting this type of error:

```bash

```

You will have to use another keyring backend to keep your keys. Here are 2 options: store the files within the cli folder or a `pass` manager.

Setting keyring backend to a **local file**:

Execute:

```bash
cyberdcli config keyring-backend file
```

As a result you migth see the following: `configuration saved to /root/.cybercli/config/config.toml`

Execute:

```bash
cyberdcli config --get keyring-backend
```

The result should be the following:

```bash
user@node:~# cyberdcli config --get keyring-backend
file
```

That means that you've set your keyring-backend to a local file. *Note*, in this case, all the keys in your keyring will be encrypted using the same password. If you would like to set up a unique password for each key, you should set a unique `--home` folder for each key. To do that, just use `--home=/<unique_path_to_key_folder>/` with setup keyring backend and at all interactions with keys when using cyberdcli:

```bash
cyberdcli config keyring-backend file --home=/<unique_path_to_key_folder>/
cyberdcli keys add <your_second_key_name> --home=/<unique_path_to_key_folder>/
cyberdcli keys list --home=/<unique_path_to_key_folder>/
```

Set keyring backend to [**pass manager**](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/9cce836c08d14dc6836d07164dd964b2b7226f36/crypto/keyring/doc.go#L30):

Pass utility uses a GPG key to encrypt your keys (but again, it uses the same GPG for all the keys). To install and generate your GPG key you should follow [this guide](https://www.passwordstore.org/) or this very [detailed guide](http://tuxlabs.com/?p=450). When you'll get your `pass` set, configure `cyberdcli` to use it as a keyring backend:

```bash
cyberdcli config keyring-backend pass
```

Verify that all of the settings went as planned:

```bash
cyberdcli config --get keyring-backend
pass
```

#### Usefull client configuration

There's some hints you may configure to simplify you interaction with client. To see all possible parameters of those hints just run:

```bash
cyberdcli config --help
```

And here's what you can configure:

```bash
Create or query an application CLI configuration file

Usage:
  cybercli config <key> [value] [flags]

Flags:
      --get    print configuration value or its default if unset
  -h, --help   help for config

Global Flags:
      --chain-id string   Chain ID of tendermint node
  -e, --encoding string   Binary encoding (hex|b64|btc) (default "hex")
      --home string       directory for config and data (default "/Users/mr_laptanovi4/.cybercli")
  -o, --output string     Output format (text|json) (default "text")
      --trace             print out full stack trace on errors
```

First of all, if you using a standalone client, it is a good idea to set up an address of a node to process all of your transactions. To do this use:

```bash
cyberdcli config node <http://node_address:port>
```

We provide a public API address: `http://titan.cybernode.ai:26657`.

> TO DO add a new address for public API

It will be useful to configure the `chain-id` to avoid entering it every time:

```bash
cyberd config chain-id euler-6
```

If you are having trouble with the [key storage](#keyring-manipulation-settings), you may want to save your home directory for your cli:

```bash
cyberdcli config --home /path_to_cli_home/.cybercli/
```

To check what is the current setup for any parameter run:

```bash
cyberdcli config --get <parameter_name>
```

#### Sending tokens

```bash
 cyberdcli tx send <from_key_or_address> <to_address> <amount_eul> --chain-id euler-6
```

#### Linking content

> Only IPFS hashes are available to use as CIDs

```bash
 cyberdcli link \
  --from=<your_key_name> \
  --cid-from=<key_phrase_to_link> \
  --cid-to=<content_that_you_want_to_link> \
  --chain-id=euler-6
```

Example of a link command:

```bash 
cyberdcli link --cid-from QmWDYzTXarWYy9UKC7Ro4xMCdSVseQPbmdnmTYsJ9zGTpK --cid-to QmVgxX3TVntSNRiQ1Kd8sE8zvEKkbEgb8PaMnA4N7w7pK3 --from fuckgoogle --chain-id euler-6 --yes
```

#### Validator launch with Tendermint KMS + Leger Nano
In this guide, you'll find the full information on how to set up your validator at cyberd by using Tenderming KMS and Ledger nano S as a keystore.

##### Preparing your Ledger
We assume you have one. If not, only buy them from trusted sources!

First of all, we'll need to prepare the Ledger to be able to work with Tendermint KMS.
We need to install the Tendermint app onto the Ledger using Ledger Live.

*Note: at the moment, you might need to enable the `developer mode` in Ledger Live settings*

If you have (initially) set up your Ledger on a different machine than the one with cyberd, you should make sure that the Ledger device is recognized by Legder Live. The best way to do this is by installing [Ledger Live](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/ledger-live) onto that particular machine and attempting to connect the Ledger device to it. This will show any possible issues or/and error codes (if they exist, of course). To deal with them, please use the [Fix connection issues](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005165269-Fix-connection-issues) guide from Ledger.

#### Installing Tendermint KMS onto the node
Normally, this has to be done according to the Tendermint [guide](https://github.com/tendermint/kms), but we will need a few extras (all instructions have been tested on KMS v0.6.3).

#### Installation

You will need the following prerequisites:

- **Rust** (stable; 1.35+) [install](https://rustup.rs/)
- **C compiler**: e.g. gcc, clang
- **pkg-config**
- **libusb** (1.0+) : for Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev`

NOTE (x86_64 only): Configure `RUSTFLAGS` environment variable:
`export RUSTFLAGS=-Ctarget-feature=+aes,+ssse3`  (generally it would be necessary to add these flags to ~/.bash-profile or ~/.profile to make them available after re-login).

We are ready to install KMS. There are 2 ways to do this: compile from source or install with Rusts `cargo-install`. We'll use the first option.

#### Compiling from source code
`tmkms` can be compiled directly from the git repository source code, using the following commands:

``` js
git clone https://github.com/tendermint/kms.git && cd kms
cargo build --release --features=ledgertm,softsign
```

If successful, it will produce the `tmkms` executable located at:
`./target/release/tmkms`.

#### KMS configuration
After compiling, we should create a settings file - `tmkms.toml`, the `secret_connection.key` file and adjust cyberd node settings.

First of all, we need to generate a connection key that will be used for communication with the Ledger device. In order to do this `cd` to the directory with tmkms executable and run the following (path to save the file is optional):

```py
cd <your_KMS_directory>/target/release/
./tmkms softsign keygen ~/.tmkms/secret_connection.key
```

Once you are done with the connection key, proceed to the config file. It could be created anywhere. It is possible to specify the path to it during tmkms launch.

Here is an example of the `tmkms.toml` config file, working with v0.6.3 of KMS:

```py
[[chain]]
id = "<current_chain_id>"
key_format = { type = "bech32", account_key_prefix = "cyberpub", consensus_key_prefix = "cybervalconspub" }
## Validator configuration
[[validator]]
addr = "tcp://localhost:26658"
chain_id = "<current_chain_id>"
reconnect = true # true is the default
secret_key = "<path_to_secret_connection.key>"
# enable the `ledger` feature
[[providers.ledgertm]]
chain_ids = ["<current_chain_id>"]
```

#### Retrieve the validator key
The last step is to retrieve the validator key that you will be using in cyberd. The Ledger device must be connected, unlocked and has the Tendermint app opened on it.  

Start `tmkms` with the following command:

```c
tmkms start -c ~/.tmkms/tmkms.toml
```

The output should look something like this:

```bash
13:28:35 [info] tmkms 0.6.3 starting up...
13:28:35 [info] [keyring:ledgertm] added consensus key cybervalconspub1zcjduepq8jv0uxx2fw4ur6gj2r3wgs374n6ys5edh9pc4rseqqcaq2yyzy2q0fhx5q
13:28:35 [info] KMS node ID: C0E0DBA8AA82D597E8F893993E66398DDE8F89B0
```

KMS may complain about the impossibility to connect to cyberd. That's fine, we'll fix this in the next section.

The output indicates the validator key that is linked to this particular device:

```bash
cybervalconspub1zcjduepq8jv0uxx2fw4ur6gj2r3wgs374n6ys5edh9pc4rseqqcaq2yyzy2q0fhx5q
```

Take *note* of the validator pubkey that appears on your screen. We will use it in the next section.

#### Configuration of Cyberd
Before we start validating, it's necessary to enanble a communication port at `cyberd` itself.  In the config file: `<your_cyberd_location>/cyberd/config/config.toml`, modify the `priv_validator_laddr` value to create a listening address/port. The port should be set according with the `[[validator]] addr =` value of your `tmkms.toml` file.

Example of `config.toml`:

```py
# TCP or UNIX socket address for Tendermint to listen on for
# connections from an external PrivValidator process
priv_validator_laddr = "tcp://127.0.0.1:26658"
```

*NOTE: if you will try to launch cyberd after enabling  `priv_validator_laddr`, and without the `tmkms` app running simultaneously, it will likely NOT start.*

To process further, we assume that `cyberd` node is synced on your machine and there were no validators created previously on that particular node. Also, you should have an imported account to `cyberdcli` that has enough bandwidth and EUL to start validator.

We also assume that the Ledger device is connected, unlocked and has the Tendermint app open.

One last thing: `tmkms` should be launched under a different console session on the same machine.

#### Validator Glossary
**Hero:** A validator node

**Ledger:** A hardware wallet

**Bandwidth:** Used to complete transactions in the cyberd blockchain. The amount of your bandwidth is calculated in the following way:
`your_eul_tokens / all_eul_tokens_in_cyberd * 2000*1000*100`

Messages cost is `500` (excluding linking). Transaction consists of one or more messages `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`. Transaction cost is `300 + c_1 + c_2 ... + c_n`, where `c_i` - cost of `m_i` message. Full bandwidth regeneration time is 86400 blocks (24 hours)

**Commission:**  The tokens that you've earned via validating from delegators. You may take them at any time

**Delegetaors:** Users that have sent (delegated) tokens to your validator node 

**Illiquid tokens:** Non-transferable tokens that you've delegated to the validator. Delegation process duration: 1 block

**Unbonding:** The process of taking back your share (delegated tokens + any rewards).  5 days (for `euler` testnets only)

**Link:** A reference between a CID key and a CID value. Link message cost is `100*n`, where `n` is the number of links in a message. Link finalization time is 1 block. New rank for CIDs of links will be recalculated at a period of 100 to 200 blocks (from 100 to 200 seconds)

**Liquid tokens:**  Transferable tokens within the cyber blockchain

**Local keystore:** A store with keys on your local machine

**Rewards** Tokens that you've earned via delegation. To reduce network load all the rewards are stored in a pool. You can take your part of the bounty at any time

**<comission_rate_percentage>** The commission that a validator gets for their work. Must be a fraction >0 and <=1

**<delegator_address>** Delegator address. Starts with `cyber` most often coinciding with **<key_address>**

**<key_address>** An account address. Starts with `cyber`

**<key_name>** The name of an account in cybercli

**<operator_address>** Validator address. Starts with `cybervaloper`

**<shares_percentage>** The part of illiquid tokens that you want to unbond or redelegate. Must be a fraction >0 and <=1

**<testnet_chain_id>** The current version of the testnet (currently `euler-6`).

## :moneybag: Section subtitle: Beep, beep, beep...
> You are now off Earth and in orbit. Earth is still seen in the illuminatros. Before we leave our solar system, you decide to improve your knowledge. 

You can't save the galaxy unless you have the right resources for it. This section will teach you about cybernomics, CYB, THC and will touch again on the distribution and its future impact on the project.

### Cybernomics
**Q:** What is cybernomics? <br>
**A:** As explained by [@xhipster](https://github.com/xhipster/cybernomics), Cybernomics is a scientific study of provable control, computing and communication in intelligent beings and amongst them (grammar changed). This means that by cybernomic we can refer to an intellegent communciation economy. Cyber offers such an economic model, where computaion, inicnitives, communciation, utility, bandwidth and third-party storage all come together to shape a useful model. Backed by cybers distribution model, conissitng out of techical games, gifts, inflation, computation and karma. 

The purpose of this section is to examine this model, mention possible futrue plans (depndedt on governance proposal decisions) and describe its value.

### General questions
<details>
  <summary>How many tokens do you have? </summary>
There are currently 2 tokens + Karma
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why do you have 2 tokens? </summary>
Due to technical limitations, there is no way to have all of the described below characteristics in one token. We do not think that having several tokens is a bad thing. In the future, there might be other tokens on top of the DAO or/and the protocol. Of course, if they are proven to help the economics and the agents of that economics.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are the names of your tokens and what does each one do? </summary>
We have 2 tokens. CYB and THC (pronounced as TECH). CYB is the native token of the system and is used for security and bandwidth. THC is used as a governance token in our Ethereum DAO.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is Karma </summary>
You can think of Karma as of your useful reputation. Karma is calculated from your contribution to the knowldge grapph (submitted cyberlinks). Its non-transfarbale and you cannot trade it. However you can, of course, sell your private key with a vertain amoutn of Karma in it. But would you sell your soul?
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How many tokens are there? </summary>
1 PCYB of tokens (and growing). And 700 TTHC.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are MCYB / GCYB / TCYB / PCYB? </summary>
Those are representations of the amounts of CYB tokens in mega, giga, tera, peta, etc. I.E. 1GCYB of tokens is 1 Giga CYB of tokens or 1 with 9 zeros, which equals to 1 billion. 1 GCYB = 1000000000 CYB
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why do you need so many CYB tokens? </summary>
We want to show the world that the digital age contains a lot of numbers. Much more than we can think of. Nature strives towards huge numbers. Grains of sand, neurons, stars in the sky, etc.
On a lower-level, search queries go well beyond billions. This means that we need a lot of tokens to search for a lot of things.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is the CYB token? </summary>
CYB is a native token of cyber powered by the Tendermint consensus algorithm. It has 3 primary uses: (1) staking for consensus, (2) bandwidth limiting for submitting cyberlinks, and (3) expression of will for the computing of cyber~Rank by the agents.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is THC? </summary>
THC is an Ethereum based ERC-20 token that has utility value in the form of control over cyber~ Foundation and the ETH from the distribution games. It is a governance token. The creative powers of THC come from the ability to receive 1 CYB token per each (one) THC token when locking it before the end of cyber~Auction.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is there anything else I can do with the tokens? </summary>
Not in Cyber. I.E. CYB tokens do not have transactional costs. We use bandwidth instead. This means that transactions are free on one hand, but on the other hand, they require you to own at least something to make a transaction and hence, are protected from spam. On the other hand, THC tokens are Ethereum based, so - yes, they have transactional costs withing the Ethereum ecosystem (transactions cost gas).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are Resource Credits (RC)? </summary>
Resource credits are our name for bandwidth amount of an account in the protocol. They are calculated from the liquid stake of an account and allow users to transact. Transactions in the protocol are everything that is done on-chain (on the blockchain). This can be linking, sending tokens, ranking, etc.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are the distribution games? </summary>
The distribution games are a way of improving the distribution of tokens to a higher number of participants in a fairer way through a gamified process.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What do you need them for? </summary>
There are 3 distribution games proposed in total. Their goal is to help increase the initial efficiency of the distribution.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can you explain what are EUL / GOL tokens? </summary>
They are both experimental tokens needed to launch the productive equivalent. EUL is the testing equivalent of CYB and GOL of THC.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is the inflation model endless? </summary>
The inflation in cyberd is defined by validators.
</details>

### The distribution games in detail
We have already mentioned the distribution games briefly. Their purpose is to increase traction and improve distribution. 

There is a total of 3 games, with 2 of them, parts of 1:

- [Game of Links](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/): Is currently happening. Lasts till the end of the first donation round, with a 21 day final after. The main goal of the participants is to win, as many tokens as possible, from cyber~Congress and its seed donators
- Game of Thrones: Will start after the launch of the mainnet and last for 21 days. It is day 0 of the following auction. Its purpose is to battle out 2 communities (ETH and ATOM) for a bigger stake
- cyber~Auction: Will start after GoT is over and accounted for. It is an auction that lasts for a little over 479 days. Its purpose is to fill cyber ~Foundation with money

#### Game of Links or GoL
As mentioned the purpose is to win as many tokens as possible from cyber~Congress and its seed donators. The idea originates with Cosmoses Game of Stakes. This allows to achieve two results simultaneously: test the network, result in a better distribution. PoS is known for not having anything at stake. PoW distributes tokens to those who spend resources and it makes sense. Here, the idea is similar. Use your resources and/or time and acquire tokens via utility. 

There are 7 different disciplines in GoL. Meaning that there are 7 ways to participate in the game. 

The disciplines that depend on the takeoff donations (this means that they are proportional to the sum of donated ATOM, more below):

- The relevance of links submitted (the higher the rank of the content, the better)
- The bandwidth load of every participant (the more you link, the better)
- Life summary of every validator (the longer your uptime is, the better)
- The amount delegated to each validator (the more a validator is delegated, the better)

Independent of takeoff donations (meaning that it does not matter how many ATOM tokens will be donated during takeoff):

- Full validator set (the more validators there are, the better)
- Community pool (experiment and participate in governance)
- euler-4 validator rewards (rewards distributed to validators for the last testnet. Essentially, this means that you cannot participate in this discipline anymore. This is mentioned for transparency)

The results of the Game and the allocation are significantly influenced by the result of the takeoff donations. If 600k ATOM tokens have been donated during the takeoff round, 10% of CYB tokens will be allocated to the Game of Links. The logic is the following: the more has been donated, the more rewards the participants acquire, the less CYB tokens are allocated back to cyber~Congress. 

The development of the project has been done thanks to donations from 10 people. ~ 3200 ETH has been spent during the last 3 years of development. For those donations, at least 4% of CYB tokens are allocated to them via the means of THC tokens from cyber~Congress. To protect the seed donators their share will be defined accordingly to the amount donated during the takeoff round.

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wBBxVsn2/takeoff-allocation.png" />

The above chart describes perfectly the allocation of 5 groups: 

- cyber~Congress (does not include inventors)
- Inventors of rounders of the protocol (2 people)
- Seed donators during the winter round (more below)
- Participators of GoL where allocation depends on takeoff round (disciplines)
- Takeoff donators (those participating in the takeoff round)

We can see that the more ATOM tokens are donated the less cyber~Congress, seed donators and its inventors acquire and the more GoL and takeoff donators get. 

Those are the amounts allocated (up - as some depend on the parametrs above)) to each descipline in CYB tokens: 

- Takeoff donators: Up to 60,000,000,000,000 CYB
- Relevance of links: Up to 15,000,000,000,000 CYB
- Bandwidth load: Up to 6,000,000,000,000 CYB
- Delegations to validators: Up to 5,000,000,000,000 CYB
- Lifetime of validators: Up to 2,000,000,000,000 CYB
- Full validator set: Up to    5,000,000,000,000 CYB (dynamic)
- euler-4 rewards: 5,000,000,000,000 CYB
- Community pool: 2,000,000,000,000 CYB (if used)

**Note:** After the initial end of GoL (90 days since the start of funding or after 600k ATOM has been donated), a 21-day final will occur. Of course, the final won't begin straight after the end of the donations, but rather after all the calculations have been done. For the final 100 TEUL will be distributed to the participants of the takeoff donation round in proportion to how much each person donated. This will allow for the participants of the takeoff round to increase their stakes and take part in playing GoL. Of course, the EUL tokens, in this case, are testnet tokens and will be provably burned before the launch of the mainnet. However, participants can participate in any discipline for an additional 21 day period and win CYB tokens. 

To read on about how to participate in GoL, where to obtain initial tokens for it and other information, please view the full post in [our blog](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/).

#### Game of Thrones or GoT
The idea is to see two of the top communities battle it out in return for more tokens. One is ETH and the second is ATOM. We have already gifted both of them proportionally to their size (9% overall). However, the gift can be seen as bootstrap fuel and had a quadratic equation to it to smooth whale accounts. 

The idea of GoT is to see one community of hodlers trying to outbid the other in return for receiving a larger discount. 10% of CYB supply is allocated per each competing community. 100 TCYB to the ATOM community for donating ATOM. And an equivalent amount to the ETH community, which will initially receive THC tokens that they can lock during the auction in exchange for CYB tokens (in other words the ETH donators can potentially receive both THC and CYB tokens). The game will last for 21 days.

To test during the testnet we have allocated 1 TEUL and 1 TGOL to the Cosmos and Ethereum communities, respectively, for testing (please see below on value of test tokens). Test of Thrones is the zero round of the test~Auction. It will last for 10 days. During this period Cosmonauts and Etherians can donate their native tokens. After that EULs and GOLs will be distributed.

The game will be monitored on a special page of cyber.page, where people will be able to follow, donate, etc. There will also be 2 Aragon based applications that will allow users to use both GoT and the auction. 

#### cyber~Auction or auction
The goal of cyber~Auction is to focus on obtaining funds for cyber ~Foundation, the community governed DAO behind the cyber protocol. It will take place after the end of the previous games and last for 500 rounds that last for 23 hours each (a little over 479 days). 

Every round has 1 billion THC is at skate. The more you donate and the less has been donated by others on that same day the more you can gain. After the end of the distribution, participants will be able to unlock their THC tokens and use them as they wish, e.i. transfer, trade, etc. As a result of the auction, the community will have access to all the donated ETH within the Aragon organization.

One more mega important part of the auction to remember, are the creative powers of THC. If you vest your THC tokens for the period of the auction, you will receive 1 CYB token for each locked THC token for the duration of the auction!

6 TGOL have been allocated for the test~Auction. There will be a mock period of 60 days, during which community can donate in ETH and claim GOL tokens on a daily basis.  

### Understanding what goes where
The economics of cyber can be confusing at first sight. It isn't. Let's try to go over what pot goes where, why and to whom.

There are 4 parts that we can break in cybernomics to understand it easier:

- The donation rounds
- The distribution games
- The gift
- The tokens and their utility

#### Donation rounds
We can summarize that there are 4 rounds. Their purpose is to charge 2 DAOs with pots of funds so that they can develop the protocol. 

- Self-funding: The project has been self-funded over a few years with a sum closing to ~3200 ETH summed up with the winter round (not including 2020)
- Public winter round for friends: Was a public seed donator round. Information [is here](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/26a33ce5ed92204f67c79dd8036690019bcf3f89/friends/winter.md). Sumed up with self-funding, the total donated sum was ~3200 ETH (not including 2020)
- Takeoff round: The takeoff donation round is a round where up to 600k ATOM is donated to the cyber~Congress DAO via distribution games (more below). This sum is used by the DAO to support its initial ideas and the protocol via reaching [a sustainable flow of income](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues/302), including things like ATOM staking, etc
- Auction round: Is broken into 2 parts, a 21 day round and equal rounds for 479 days. During the first 21 days, ETH and ATOM are donated to the cyber~Congress DAO via the use of the auction. For the larger period of the auction. I.E. 479 days, ETH is donated to the cyber ~Foundation DAO, which is a community governed DAO, via auction proceeds in exchange for THC (governance tokens). During the second part of the auction, THC tokens can be vested and locked to later, receive CYB tokens on 1-1 basis for each locked THC token for the period of the auction 

In the end, there will be 2 separate entities (both are Aragon DAOs). The main governing entity: cyber~Foundation in charge of the ETH donated during the auction. And cyber ~Congress, the launching DAO that will carry on working on the protocol, in accordance to the governance proposals made by cyber ~Foundation and will remain as one of the entities that commits to the protocol over its remaining lifetime.

##### Takeoff extra
The takeoff donation round seem confusing at first hand, let me assure you, it isn't. Let's break it down and understand it:

- The takeoff donation round is done in ATOM (i.e. participants donate ATOM)
- The ATOM goes to cyber~Congress DAO multisig address
- The takeoff donation round is part of the distribution games, in particular, GoL
- When 90 days have passed since its start or 600k ATOm have been donated, the takeoff donation round finishes
- The end of the takeoff donation  round launched the 21-day final of GoL
- During the takeoff donation round, participants donate ATOM. The more ATOM are donated, the *less* CYB cyber~Congess leaves to itself
- The earlier you donate, the bigger your discount is. The discount is calculated with a dependence on the overall sum of ATOM donated. The more ATOM tokens have been donated, the bigger the total discount is. The earlier you donate, the bigger the total discount you can expect 
- Participants of the takeoff donation round get an extra bonus in terms of 100 TEUL distributed among them (in proportion to the donated ATOM)
- These EUL tokens can be used in the 21-day final of GoL to play and earn more CYB tokens (EUL tokens will be burned)
- All earlier involved entities (cyber~Congress, inventors of the protocol and seed donors) get *less* if more ATOM tokens have been donated during the takeoff round
- The amount of CYB tokens allocated for GoL disciplines is also dependent on the takeoff donation round! The *more* ATOm tokens have been donated, the *more* CYB tokens are allocated to disciplines of GoL

#### The distribution games
There are 3 distribution games, described above. Their purpose is to achieve the best possible distribution, gain initial traction and test all of the network's possibilities. 

- Game of Links: includes in itself the takeoff donation round, and a final after it. Started with euler-5 and will finish when the takeoff donation round is over. Its purpose is to distribute tokens from cyber~Congress to the participants. Aimed at initial believers of the protocol
- Game of Thrones: Can be thought of as the final part of GoL or window 0 of the auction. A 21-day game in which ETH and ATOM communities battle it out for the biggest pot. Aimed at speculators
- cyber~Auction: a 479-day long auction, which charges cyber ~Foundation with ETH. THC can be vested for CYB. Aimed at everyone in the community

#### The gift
cyber has dropped 10% of its supply to 3 communities:

- ETH: 8%, being the biggest dev community in the field 
- ATOM: 1%, being the engine that backs cyber and the biggest growing community of devs
- URBIT: 1%, being the most technologically advanced community in the field

The purpose of the gift is to get initial traction, attract the best communities, test interest, achieve a better distribution. There were over 1 million addresses that were eligible to receive the gift (more below).

#### The tokens and their utility
Meaning that there are 2 utility tokens in the economy (+1 bonus points token):

- CYB: The main token. Needed to create cyberlinks, transact, build the knowledge graph, etc
- THC: The governance token. Needed to make proposals. Can be locked for the auction and swapped at 1-1 basis
- Karma: Karma points aren't really a token. They are a calculation and a representation of the submission a person made to the knowledge graph. It cannot be swapped, bought, etc

This leaves us with a clearer picture of which funds and donations go where. The whole distribution can be viewed in the [launch kit repo](https://github.com/cybercongress/launch-kit/blob/0.1.0/distribution/README.md).

### CYB and THC

- tokens and utility
- transactions

### EUL and GOL

Please note, that all of the games will be tested during the testnets with EUL and GOL tokens, which are the equivelant of CYB and THC in the mainnet. The EUL tokens have little value (in regards to price value). Their main purpose is to serve as the basis for reward calculation during the Game of Links. The GOL tokens also have no significant value in terms of price. They will allow gaining EUL tokens during the game - if vested. Non-vested GOL tokens do not have any value at all. GOL tokens serve (1) as a means to provide incentivized testing of Ethereum contracts, and (2) as a spam protection mechanism for the faucet. DO NOT spend a significant amount of funds buying GOL during Test of Thrones & test~Auction and/or EUL over the counter. GOL tokens will be burned after the euler-5 testnet is over. All accounts in the euler experimental networks series will be reseted. All ETH and ATOM sent to the faucet during the Game of Links are donated to cyber ~Congress. 

| During euler-5 testnet |	During cyber mainnet |
|----------|------|
| Test of Thrones  | 	Game of Thrones | 
| test~Auction  | 	cyber~Auction | 
| GOL token  | 	THC token | 
| EUL token  | 	CYB token | 
| Takeoff donations  | 	Not applicable | 

### Gift
Cyber has gifted 3 communities as per the commitment to do so in our [White Paper](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmceNpj6HfS81PcCaQXrFMQf7LR5FTLkdG9sbSRNy3UXoZ).

Those are the Ethereum (8%), Cosmos (1%) and Urbit (1%) communities. 

The purpose of those gifts is to help the network gain traction in the beginning and to increase the initial participation. 
This will help to increase cooperation and give more participants the ability to engage in the protocol. 
We chose these specific communities because they are the best communities, in our opinion, to help to form the knowledge graph and to reach the masses.

As a result, Cyber will gain a massive benefit via the economic integration of the largest developers, the most innovative and of the most promising communities withing the open-source space. Similary, those communities will gain traction from joining forces with Cyber - the builder of the Great Web!

<details>
  <summary>What token did you gift? </summary>
We have gifted CYB, the main ecosystem utility token needed to use the protocol.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How much did you gift? </summary>
We have gifted 10% of the total supply, broken down as per the following: Ethereum: 8%, Cosmos: 1%, Urbit: 1%.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Who received the gift? </summary>
ETH hodlers with at least 1 outgoing transaction (non-contract addresses only). And a balance bigger than 0.2 ETH at block 8080808.
ATOM hodlers within Cosmos hub-2 at block 1110000 which held any balance bigger than 0.
URBIT aliens that had planets, stars or galaxies on the 18.12.2019 (with at least one outgoint tx on the corresponding ETH address).

Please note that ATOM and ETH gifts were distributed proportionally to the square root of each account balance during the snapshots.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How many addresses received gifts? </summary>
Ethereum: 998015 addresses. Cosmos: 10715. Urbit: 884.
</details>

<details>
  <summary> Was anyone else gifted?</summary>
Not exactly. However, there were 76 validator addresses in Euler-4 (one of our public testnets) that received tokens for their work.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I check the balance of my gift? </summary>
There are at least 3 ways to do so:
The easiest and the quickest: go to cyber.page and just enter your ETH or ATOM address in the search bar. This will result in a EUL (testnet token) balance if you met the requirements for the gift.
You may connect your ledger device on cyber.page to check out the ATOM gift balance. Simply connect your ledger and follow the steps.
You may use gift tools from the launch-kit to check your gift balance (this requires some technical skills)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I check my balance if my tokens are on a Ledger? </summary>
Simply export your ETH / ATOM account address and use one of the options above
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I claim my gift? </summary>
You do not need to. If you were lucky enough to receive a gift, they are yours already! Cyber addresses can be generated from a Cosmos seed or an ETH private key. This means that if you received a gift, just create an address and it will already have a balance!
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How to create a cyber address? </summary>
One way is to use your Ledger with cyber.page (for ATOM only).
The other one is to install cyberdCLI and create an address (this requires technical skills.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Will the gift burn if I don't take it now? </summary>
Simply put - no. You don't need to worry about this as long as cyber is alive and you have the keys to claim the gift.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>So, I've received a gift. What can I do with it now? </summary>
Start playing The Game! By playing you can receive more tokens! The Game of Links is a game with a lot of technical disciplines and incentives. The main goal of the participants is to win, as many tokens as possible, from cyber~Congress and its seed donators.


If you have your tokens on a Ledger account from an ATOM gift, simply go on cyber.page, follow the instructions closely and start linking!

Other ways to participate in the game is to install cyberdcli and add your ledger account as a cold wallet with the --ledger flag.

In all other cases, look for your Cosmos seed or ETH private key, install cyberdcli and play from the CLI. Of course, you may also set-up a validator node and participate in the other disciplines. Find more information in this blog post.
</details>

<details>
  <summary> What else can I do with the tokens?</summary>
HODL...
</details>

<details>
  <summary>But I want CYB, and I received EUL. What's going on? </summary>
EUL is the testnet name of CYB. When the mainnet launches, all EUL tokens will be converted to CYB tokens.

FYI GOL is the test name for THC (the governance token).

Important Euler-5 is a testnet with a different total supply to the cyber mainnet. The supply in the mainnet is larger, hence due to change of supply and due to the results of the Game of Links, balances may and will change. Of course, proportions to total supply are kept between the networks.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I know my ETH / ATOM / URBIT keys are safe? </summary>
Your keys are stored locally with you. We do not ask for your keys. If you did not enter them anywhere, we do not know them. Please refrain from entering your seed / private key anywhere. This is not safe!


It is a good practice to transfer any balance you have out of an address after you have claimed a gift. I.E. if I claimed a git using my ETH address and had a balance on that address. It might be a good idea to move that balance out to a new address for extra security.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why do I need to take the gift? </summary>
First of all - you are not obliged to anything. But if you understand the purpose of cyber, then the more tokens you will have, the more options open up to you in regards to search, building the knowledge graph and creating the new Great Web. Cyber is a decentralized google, for provable and relevant answers that you can be a part of.
</details>

### cyber~Congress's + seed investors pot
The pot that cyber~Congress accounts for is dependent on dynamic parameters. It can be broken into 2 categories:

- Any self-funded funds from team members and/or inventors
- Donated ATOMs during seed, takeoff, etc donation rounds

- Up to 6.4% of CYB tokens to the DAO, dependent on the donated ATOMs during takeoff round (the more donated, the smaller the pot)
- Up to 3.2% of CYB tokens to the inventors, dependent on the donated ATOMs during takeoff round (the more donated, the smaller the pot)

The pot of seed investors is also dynamic. It depends on the donations during takeoff round and can be up to 6.4% of CYB tokens.

Please note, that the more ATOMs there are donated the LOWER the above mentioned pots become. At most, the 3 pots can sum up to 16%, at lowest they can sum up to 10%.

**Vital** cyber~Congress and seed investors are NOT the same entity, however some people might overcross. We are publishing these numbers, solely, for transparency!

In other words, up to 97 TTHC (the governance token) is allocated to inventors, team members, including [possible incentives](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/teams/incentives.md) and to seed donators. 

Those THC tokens can (and most likely will) be vested for the period of cyber~Acution to receive an equal amount of CYB tokens. This means that cyber~Congress might posses between 9-10% (including incentives) of CYB and THC tokens. This does not include any personal pots acquired by inventors or DAO members, as this is virtually impossible to account for unless the DAO members will disclose this information.

From those funds, a certain portion will be allocated towards the creation of [cyber~FundClassic](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/ELI-5%20FAQ.md#who-are-cyberfundclassic), which will be a for-profit DAO responsible for finding teams that develop cyber and fund them with initial bags.  

Apart from this, cyber~Congress will also hold a certain amount of ATOMs donated during the takeoff donation round and some ATOMs that will be donated during GoT. 

### Possible future amendments
In the future, cyber~Congress or any other user might propose amendments to the economy via governance proposals. It will be up to the governance to decide whether or not these amendments will take place. 

### Where is the money Lebowski?
We can break the understanding of this into 4 categories. Before we do that. It is vital to understand that the real value of computers and protocols comes from utility, development and adoption on a later stage. We see 4 groups that have various interests in the protocol:

- cyber~Congress: it is up to cyber ~Congress to reach a sustainable flow of income and to obtain funding from governance proposals as either the or one of the developing teams
- Evangelists: the ambassadors of cyber. As we see it, they possess both, a speculative interest and in sharing the idea of changing the world. Their value comes mainly from building a social knowledge graph, referring donators, participating in games, etc
- Heroes: the validators of cyber. Possibly large donators, but primarily infrastructure providers. Earn from supplying infrastructure and inflation
- Masters: the users of cyber. The largest group. They can have an income from inflation via delegating to heroes. They can also take part in shaping up web3, providing services, marketing, advertising, selling goods, creating markets, etc, in the new Great Web

-------------------------------------------------------

## :church: Section subtitle: `Incoming missile alert` - Prepare to retaliate
> Captain, the computer is delivering hostile actions. Preparing missiles to fire back... Wait! Let's send our secret weapon across. Teleport the evangelists!

This section will explain about the ambassadors of cyber. They are the projects evangelists. They are the secret weapon building a social knowledge graph using their skills and a set of tools provided by cyber to earn karma and rewards.

### cyber~Evangelism
Cyber understands that it needs a secret weapon to battle evil. The evangelists of cyber have several tasks:

- Help to boost the Superintelligence into space by helping with the takeoff round
- Help building the initial social graph and attracting developers, heroes and masters
- Help spread the gospel to as many people as possible

They are a free entity, helped by a coordinator, at first as part of the euler~Foundation with the help of cyber\~Congress, only then to become so powerful as to separate from the Congress and to become a special unit of the cyber\~Foundation. The main dish of the protocol.

The evangelists are a techno religious entity. They are free to perform the actions they believe in, after they become blessed by the gods of cyber. However, they can sin and get punished by getting kicked out of heaven. 

Behind the scenes, the magic happens using Aragon and euler~Foundation:

- Evangelists live in [euler~Fondation](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/eulerfoundation) on ETH mainnet
- We use one of [our apps](https://github.com/cybercongress/aragon-evangelism-app) to perform the transformation of believers into evangelists
- Believers sacrifice themselves via [cyber.page](https://cyber.page/) and submit a form (all using a Ledger)
- They get blessed by [the current gods](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/cybercongress) 
- They start to build their social knowledge graph and earn rewards

#### OBEP
OBEP stands for Open Bootstrap Evangelism program. This is the initial evangelism program for cyber to help during the kickoff and the takeoff donation round. Evangelists who get blessed during this period, have a very powerful reputation boost in the future of cyber. Their religious karma can become so powerful, they might become gods themselves. You never know.

Acknowledged Evangelists will be eligible to 10% of all donations in ATOMs, which they have generated during the Game of Links and Game of Thrones and more perks, such as:

- Rewards in ATOM
- CYB tokens for specific actions
- Honourable lifetime badge Genesis Evangelist of Cyber
- Early knowledge of popularity mechanisms in web3
- A possibility to become an early adopter of web3

There are NO guidelines or rules for the program itself. Do what you believe will work. However, 2 requirements are necessary to receive rewards:

1) You must become an acknowledged Evangelist to receive a reward in ATOM or/and CYB. We want to exclude scam behaviour and situations when the project has been evangelised by people without a thorough understanding of the project.
2) You must have proof that a particular donation came thanks to your amazing evangelism. An address or a nickname in the memo field of the donated transaction is proof that no one can reject.

The full rules of the program can be [found here](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/edit/master/ecosystem/donations/obep.md).

#### How to read the gospel
Go to [cyber.page/path/evangelist](https://cyber.page/path/evangelist) and apply for the program. You will either receive an automated acknowledgement (blessing) or we will contact you to ask you any additional questions. For example, we could ask you to commit something to the knowledge graph. Or you might get accepted based on the fact that you have helped to bring in donations. So don't hesitate. That is decentralization. Do not wait for our approval, but please understand our concern! Manual acknowledgements are the only way that our project can defend itself from scammers at this early stage.

Once you apply, you will get your referral link. It looks like this:
```
https://cyber.page/thanks/xhipster
```
You can append `/thanks/[yournick]/` to any part of the [cyber.page](https://cyber.page/) app. e.g:
```
https://cyber.page/search/google/thanks/xhipster
https://cyber.page/takeoff/thanks/xhipster
```

Referral attributions work best on first click basis.

#### How to spread the word
We believe it is important to understand the working of what is under the hood. One of our noble goals is to create a new verb:

```
cyber: to do something intelligent, to find something smart
```

The path with the necessary information to kick you off:

1. Read the basic materials: [whitepaper](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPjbx76LycfzSSWMcnni6YVvV3UNhTrYzyPMuiA9UQM3x), [ELI-5 FAQ](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/ELI-5%20FAQ.md), [our blog](https://cybercongress.ai/post/), [Game of Links rules](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/), [gift info](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Gift%20FAQ%20and%20general%20gift%20information.md) and the [homestead draft](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md). It would be a good idea to discover [Protoschool](https://proto.school/) and get some tutorials about how [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) works. You don't need to fully understand all of this, but try to grasp the general idea and get a feel of it.

2. Feel free to go on and test [cyber~Page](https://cyber.page/). Cyberlink something. Try to [search something](https://cyber.page/search/google). Go to the [Game of Links monitor](https://cyber.page/gol) and enjoy our approach of a decentralised launch of a superintelligent computer. Learn the [stats](https://cyber.page/brain). Imagine [how cool](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/usecases.md) the search could be if we teach cyber a bit more together.

3. Find out that everything is real and [the code is 100% open](https://github.com/cybercongress).

4. If you have questions, go to our [TG channel](https://t.me/fuckgoogle). If you want to spur a discussion, then you are welcome at [cyber~Forum](https://ai.cybercongress.ai/). Or you can spread the love with us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cyber_devs), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybercongress/) or any [other social channels](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#partnering-communities).

5. It's time to act. Here are the ideas:

|Action  | Rewards | Terms |
|:----------|:-------------:|------:|
| [Translation](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber/issues/32) | 20 GCYB | Any language! |
| [Meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS6w6wiAag4&list=PLOcP3DXQoNUXmh7ob0Fm6p12L20zn0zbT&index=6) | 20 GCYB | One person - one meetup. Video proof |
| [Community creation](https://t.me/fuckgoogle) | 2 GCYB | One person - one channel. Discussion proof |
| [Content creation](https://ai.cybercongress.ai/t/mentions-of-the-beast-in-the-wild/40/55) |  2 GCYB |  Video, podcast or blog. Unlimited per person
| [Donation](https://cyber.page/takeoff)  | 1 GCYB  | For each 1k ATOM donated |

*Please note, that payouts will only be done if the results are cyberlinked and content proof exists.*

We are not defining quality terms. Most likely, you will still receive a reward for shitty content if the task was done, but expect to be disqualified from the program, or instructed, depending on your will to learn. 

Coordinator aka @serejandmyself will have a personal incentive in the form CYB for evangelist attraction. For the first evangelist (not including team members of cyber~Congress) the coordinator receives 15 GCYB. For every next evangelist (not including team members of cyber ~Congress) the reward decreases by 10%. 

-------------------------------------------------------

## :rocket: Section subtitle: `Houston` we (don't) have a problem
> How typical is it for a spaceship to break when you are least waiting for it! Earth is not seen to the naked eye anymore, but you don't miss home anymore...

This section will teach you about hardware, governance and survival in deep space. After this, we will be considered true cosmonauts. Let's dive in into hardware, governance and the technical guides of cyber.

### Governance
The easiest section of this guide, yet the most important one! I have specifically separated it from the masters' section, as it is obvious that governance is not related to masters only, but all space agents. We will be adding best practises for proposals as this guide progresses with examples, for now, let's discuss the general scope of things.

#### cyber~Foundation
First, let's make things straight. Cyber is a decentralized Google. Cybers mission is to decentralize the services and the infrastructure of the internet via the use of blockchain technology and cyberlinks. Cyber is an innovative search protocol. Such a protocol should not be owed by one company, but rather be governed by its stakeholders, that can decide on its development via the use of governance mechanisms.

We are concerned about following the principles of decentralization and believe that DAOs are a vital ingredient in achieving it. We use Aragon-bred DAOs for governance within our project.

In other words, euler~Foundation is a DAO, launched by another DAO, for the community that will govern the cyber protocol. This means, that it is the stakeholders that will decide on the fate of the protocol via voting on proposals. 

So, should such a thing be owned by a company or a small number of beneficiaries? No. Good tech does not require CEOs, CTOs or any other bingo bullshit fairytale creatures. Good tech requires good governance. Hence, as we have outlined in our WP and in many sections of this document the protocol s to be governed by the community who are its stakeholders. 

There are 2 parts to the governance. There is the native cyber chain governance which will relate to various important updates, technical upgrades, any chain-related matters and it will be held in CYB tokens (or EUL for the euler epoch). 

There is the second part of the governance mechanism, which will be decided on by THC holders (at this point I don't feel the need to explain over and over again what is THC, please see previous sections or use the `CNTRL-F` option). THC holders are shaped like a fund, with its own bag of dough in ETH, one of the most promising tokens out in the wild. These ETH tokens will be donated to cyber\~Foundation throughout GoT and cyber\~Auction. 

cyber~Foundation is going to be charged with apps and will live in Aragon, the most promising governance project so far in the space. And here we come to euler\~Foundation, the testing version of the Foundation.

euler~Foundation is the testing of the Foundation DAO. It is deployed to ETH's mainnet during GoL (gamified part of cybers distribution process). Its main purpose is to test everything, that can be tested, before the launch of the mainnet and provide the initialization for the security audit on the initial stage, plus obtain feedback from the cyber community.

The euler\~Foundation is already deployed into ETH mainnet and has a huge deployment story that was documented from head to bottom. It is already charged with the evangelism app, the auction app and the vesting app. All of these apps are open source and you should read about what they do. Here are the links to check out:

- [euler~Founation in Aragon](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/eulerfoundation)
- [Intro post](https://cybercongress.ai/euler-ceremony/) on the deployemnt process
- The [deploemyent ceremony guide](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber-foundation/blob/master/euler-foundation/foundation.md)
- [The repository](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber-foundation) with all the docs and app description

We can sum up that cyber~Foundation is indeed the main governing body of the protocol. It is up to you to decide on the future. Be in charge of your destiny!

#### Participating in governance 
There are two things to mention:

1) Go and get EUL tokens by playing [the Game of Links](https://cyber.page/gol), there are 2 TCYB allocated for the [community pool dicipline](https://cyber.page/governance), take a part in it. Yes, cyber has an in-built energy model. This means that transactions are free, but require energy, which regenerates over time. You can get tokens by [claiming your gift](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#claiming-the-gift) or by using our [test auction faucet](https://cyber.page/gol/faucet) and vesting the acquired GOLs. You may even acquire GOL on Uniswap. In the case you do not have a gift, I advise you to check out [this guide post](https://cybercongress.ai/how-to-get-eul-tokens-if-you-have-none/) that will help you to acquire EUL tokens.
2) Participate in governance and vote! Let's see how to do this:

#### Voting on proposals and what you should know
Let's head over to cyber.page and teleport to the [governance tab](https://cyber.page/governance):

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/nLhv6qXj/Screenshot-from-2020-04-22-13-03-54.png" />

We need the proposals that are in `Voting Period`. Let's click on one of these:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/TwrY04Tr/Screenshot-from-2020-04-22-13-04-59.png" />

You should carefully read all the info, scroll down, investigate all the links that the proposer added. make sure you understand what is going on and why you are required to vote or abstain. 

In the box at the bottom, on the left side we have 4 options:
- Yes: vote yes for the current proposal
- No: vote no for the current proposal
- Abstain: vote neither yes or no, but cast a vote. This is important to show the community that you are a responsible stakeholder and care about the lofe of the protocol
- No With Veto: vote no on the proposal and Veto it, meaning you have a strong opinion against it going forward

Please make note of these points when voting:
- Only staked (bonded) tokens can participate in governance. This is vital for excluding speculators and onlookers from attacks on the governance
- Voting power is measured in terms of stake. The number of tokens you stake determines your influence on the decision (coin voting)
- Delegators inherit the vote of the validators they are delegated to unless they cast their own vote, which will overwrite validator decisions
- Quorum level: determines the minimum amount of staked tokens that need to participate in the voting
- Threshold level: determines the minimum amount of tokens that participated in the vote (after excluding `Abstain` votes) that need to have voted in favour of the proposal (`Yes`)
- Veto:  Less than 33.4% of the tokens that participated in the vote (after excluding `Abstain` votes) need to have vetoed the decision (`No with Veto`)

Let's vote for a proposal. I think that this should pass, hence I will vote `yes`. Make sure that `yes` is selected and click the `Vote` button. Then select the option best suited for you that will take care of your vote. I will be using my Ledger (make sure your Ledge is connected and the Cosmos app is open):

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/XJQNtyyJ/Screenshot-from-2020-04-22-13-19-17.png" />

Click `Generate TX` and confirm on your Ledger and don't forget to click the `FuckGoogle` button at the end. You will see your tx ID. Congratulations, we have voted! To see your vote go to [your flight desk](https://cyber.page/pocket), select your account, then click on the tx section. You will see the status of your vote. If you click on the tx hash, you will see the detail of the transaction. At the very bottom, you will see a `Vote Option` section and a `yes` next to it. Good job!

#### Creating proposals
This section will eventually grow exponentially with ideas, practises and examples. For the time being, let's keep this simple. Head over to the governance tab:

Click on the `Create Governance` button in the bottom right corner. Make sure you Ledger is connected with the Cosmos app open. A screen will appear:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/pLFfxPCx/Screenshot-from-2020-04-22-13-29-42.png" />

Here, add the title, the description and the amount in EUL tokens you want to deposit and hit the `Create Governance` button again. Follow the instructions on your Ledger device. If everything was done correctly it will appear on the governance page. Spread the news to the community about your proposal. It is best to have a good description and to include a link to it, so you don't overload the screen for readers. After all, it is vital to understand what you want others to vote on!

For now, please refer to the [best practices guide](https://github.com/gavinly/CosmosCommunitySpend) from Figment Networks on Cosmos (as it as reference only, do not follow the commands or the numbers as they will NOT match cybers).

### What can I use to connect to cyber?
What points of access can I use to connect to cyber? They have all been covered in this guide, but here is the list again:

- [cyber.page](https://cyber.page/): Requires a ledger for most actions
- [The CLI](https://cybercongress.ai/docs/cyberd/ultimate-commands-guide/): Requires to set up a node or use a remote node
- [cyb~Virus](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb-virus): Archived! Unsafe to import private keys into this app
- [cyb~Snap](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb-snap): Still in the making
- [cyb](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb): Currently, feature frozen 

### How does cyber work?
Let's try and understand how does cyber work, starting with the very basic theory and going up to the more technical parts:

#### Simple explanation
Cyber is a decentralized google, for provable and relevant answers.

 The explanation below is NOT going to be simple, so please do not be put off by it. All the terminology used in the first explanation WILL be explained in detail later in this document. Let me assure you, that if you keep on reading, you will be able to understand Cyber with almost zero previous knowledge.

Cyber is essentially creating a brand new protocol (a procedure that helps computers to do things in a certain way) for adding and searching information onto a knowledge graph (a compilation of facts about something that provides meaning to the user). And rank this information. In other words, it's a decentralized google.

Users create links between 2 IPFS hashes (keep on reading to see what this is) and place them on a knowledge graph by spending bandwidth (amount of data that can be transmitted over a fixed period of time). Users also link IPFS hashes linked to keywords, which helps to enrich the knowledge graph with... knowledge.

That content is then dynamically ranked with the help of digital tokens and the current parameters of the networks load. This makes the rank dynamic (characterized by continuous change, activity, or progress).

All this is computed (determined with the help of a computer) by validators (a program or a computer that are responsible for checking the validity of something). The validators do so, by using their GPU's (literally - graphics cards).

This allows to search data on the web, rank it, query it (look it up) and create knowledge databases without blackbox intermediaries (third parties that try to censor data, hide or push specific results to obtain money, track your data, etc).

The interesting thing is that such a simple mechanism allows creating a lot of powerful tools as a result. We will go in-detail further down the document into those. For example: unified semantics, SEO instruments, autonomous robots, and a lot more.

#### Advanced explanation
Cyber is an innovative, general-purpose search and knowledge protocol. It is a distributed computer for answers. 

Within the network, masters generate knowledge graphs with the use of what we call cyberlinks. A cyberlink is simply a link between two content-based links (for now, read IPFS hashes). This allows for a naturally enriched semantic link. The link is required for the computation of relevance of subjects and objects within the knowledge graph, in other words, ranking and indexing.
IPFS provides cyber with the superpowers that were inaccessible to previous architectures of general-purpose search engines. Such as significant benefits with regards to resource consumption.

To achieve determinism, we need to agree on the things we do, and here is where cyber introduces a consensus computer, its implementation is a 64-bit Tendermint consensus computer of relevance for 64-byte string-space. The computer process the links, along with computation, storage and the bandwidth. Computation and storage in case of a basic relevance machine can be easily predicted based on bandwidth, but bandwidth requires a limiting mechanism.

*The relevance machine*
The relevance machine is in some way a mirror of the will of the universe that surrounds us. It enables a simple construction for the search mechanism via querying and delivering answers. This mechanism is based on the will of the users building the knowledge graph.

Instead of deducting the meaning inside of the consensus computer (and returning to the blackbox principle of web2), we have designed a system in which extraction of the meaning is incentivized. This is achieved due to masters needing CYB tokens to express their will, based on which, the relevance machine can compute rank. In other words, we can be sure that if someone is willing to back it up, it is subjectively relevant to this someone at this moment and time.

With the help of Resource Credits (RC) and the user’s stake, we have developed a very simple bandwidth model. The principal goal of this model is to reduce the daily network growth to a given constant. This is done to help heroes (validators) to forecast any future investment into infrastructure. RC and recovery windows allow the network to determine bandwidth and its load. Of course, this also provides a basic anti-spam mechanism.

The relevance machine works just like the human mind. It neither stores the past, nor the current (full) state to maintain usefulness. Or more precisely, it always remains relevant. As a result, the cybernomics (economy) of CYB tokens, serves not just as will-expression and spam-protection mechanisms. It also functions as an economics regulation tool that can align heroes processing the knowledge graph and create demand for market processing.

*cyber~Rank*
IPFS hashes (or content identifiers or simply - CIDs) are vital for the network. CIDs as primary objects are robust in their simplicity. For every CID, cyber ~Rank is computed by the consensus computer without a single point of failure.

cyber~Rank is a token weighted PageRank with economic protection from Sybil attacks and self-centred voting. Every round the Merkle root of the rank tree is published. Consequently, every computer can prove to any other computer the relevance of value for any given CID. This allows us to create a cryptographically provable map of information, down to the very source, inside cyber.

The rank is calculated by using the outgoing and the incoming weight of the current state of the staked tokens in the system and the current and the previous ranks in the system. The rank mechanism also utilizes the current bandwidth (load) of the system and is hence - a dynamic property. The rank is constantly recalculated by the validators using GPUs.

Ironically, the ranking mechanism is based on none other but the PageRank. Yes, the one that was developed by Sergey Brin and Larry Page. The key problem with the original PageRank is that it wasn’t resistant to Sybil attacks. However, a token-weighted PageRank is limited by a token-weighted bandwidth model and does not inherit the problems of the native PageRank. It is resistant to Sybil-attacks.

The beauty behind the ranking mechanism is that it only accounts for the current intention of the masters and encourages rank inflation of cyberlinks. At first, this might seem a bit unclear. But, it is vital for the system, to (a) not to be interfered with. Which is ensured by the users staking their tokens against a given CID. And (b) is essential in order not to get cemented in the past. As new cyberlinks are continuously added they dilute the rank of the already existing links proportionally. This means that this is a constantly self-evolving, mind-like mechanism where the relevance of information is always up to date with the will of the users.

*The future*
Our proposed semantics of linking data offers a mechanism for predicting meaningful relations between objects by the consensus computer. The source-code of the relevance machine is 100% open-source. All of our code is 100% open-source. Every bit of data accumulated by the consensus computer is available to anyone if one has the resources to process it.

Though the system presents the necessary service to allow for an alternative to a conventional search engine, it is not limited to this use case.  Check out the [possible use cases in this section](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#usecases).

### Technical guides
We understand that you need to learn a lot to grasp Cyber. We are talking IPFS, Tendermint, Consensus mechanisms, blockchain tech, search mechanics, the global issues with web2 and much more. But we think that learning is cool. And in all honesty, we learn along with you. I will compile guides and resources that will help you to grasp cyber and to get a better understanding of web3. 

#### Overview of the learning curve
Let's understand what we will need. some parts will be theoretical and some will require you to install extensions, companions, read things, exercise your brain a bit. 

We need to understand a few things, here is a brief overview:
- Physics: Check out what is an electromagnetic impulse, the basic laws of physics and maths
- IT theory: I suggest you start with the simple understanding of how computers function, what is code, how did telegraphs become computers and how do they count
- Blockchain theory: Check out Bitcoin, read the WP, understand the progression from blockchain 1.0 to 3.0 and whar are distributed and decentralised machines
- Economical theory and game theory: Check out the basics economics theories of the last century, take a deeper dive at something like the history of money. Then move to game theory
- Consensus and governance theory: Try understanding what is a consensus and timing in terms of computing, research governance history all the way back to the Mohicans 
- Cryptography and DB: Stick to basics, understand how databases work, check out basic encryption methods 
- Understanding Cosmos and Tendermint: Check out what is Cosmos, read their intro, watch the research videos, check out the podcasts 
- IPFS and routing: study about web2 first, dive into location and content-based addressing, understand the OSI model and how packets are routed
- Search engine theory: Read about the history of Google, try to understand the importance of semantics, read about PageRank

##### IPFS
We strongly suggest that you check out Protoschool for understanding the basics and even become an advanced IPFS user. You don't need to understand every single thing that is explaned, but we suggest you try to download IPFS, install the compnaion and try to run it.

[Protoschool link](https://proto.school/#/)

There are 2 guides that we think are very importnat to understnad. They are partially copied from the IPFS GitHub, and slighlty changed to suit our needs:

*Features*

*Automagical Detection of IPFS Resources*

*IPFS Path in URL*

Requests for IPFS-like paths (`/ipfs/{cid}` or `/ipns/{peerid_or_host-with-dnslink}`) are detected on any website.  
If tested path is a [valid IPFS address](https://github.com/ipfs/is-ipfs) it gets redirected and loaded from a local gateway, e.g:  
> `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbWqxBEKC3P8tqsKc98xmWNzrzDtRLMiMPL8wBuTGsMnR`  
> → `http://127.0.0.1:8080/ipfs/QmbWqxBEKC3P8tqsKc98xmWNzrzDtRLMiMPL8wBuTGsMnR`

*DNSLink*

Companion will detect presence of [DNSLink](https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/concepts/dnslink/) in DNS records of visited websites and redirect HTTP request to a local gateway.

> `http://docs.ipfs.io`  
> → `http://127.0.0.1:8080/ipns/docs.ipfs.io`

This means if you visit websites with a valid DNSLink (eg. https://docs.ipfs.io, https://ipld.io, http://tr.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org) browser will load them from IPFS.

More details: [DNSLink Support in IPFS Companion](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/blob/master/docs/dnslink.md)

*X-Ipfs-Path*

Companion will upgrade transport to IPFS if the header is found in any HTTP response headers. This is a fallback for edge cases when IPFS path is not present in URL.

More details: [`x-ipfs-path` Header Support in IPFS Companion](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/blob/master/docs/x-ipfs-path-header.md)

*Redirect Opt-Out*

It is possible to opt-out from Gateway redirect by:
- a) suspending redirect via global toggle (see [_Disable All Redirects_](#disable-all-redirects) below)
- b) suspending redirect for via per website opt-out (in [_Active Tab_ section of _Browser Action_](#disable-gateway-redirect-per-website) or _Preferences_)
- c) including `x-ipfs-companion-no-redirect` in the URL (as a [hash](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbWqxBEKC3P8tqsKc98xmWNzrzDtRLMiMPL8wBuTGsMnR#x-ipfs-companion-no-redirect) or [query](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbWqxBEKC3P8tqsKc98xmWNzrzDtRLMiMPL8wBuTGsMnR?x-ipfs-companion-no-redirect) parameter).

*IPFS API as `window.ipfs`*

Your IPFS node is exposed as `window.ipfs` on every webpage.
Websites can detect if `window.ipfs` exists and opt-in to use it instead of creating their own `js-ipfs` node.
It saves system resources and battery (on mobile), avoids the overhead of peer discovery/connection, enables shared repository access and more!
Make sure to read our [notes on `window.ipfs`](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/blob/master/docs/window.ipfs.md), where we explain it in-depth and provide examples on how to use it your own dapp.

*Quick Toggles*

The Browser Action pop-up provides handy toggles for often used operations.

*Disable Gateway Redirect Per Website*

> _Active Tab_ actions include option to opt-out current website from Gateway redirect of any IPFS subresources.    
> Disabling redirect for DNSLink website will restore original URL as well:
>
> ![per-site-opt-out](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/157609/55317805-90452900-5471-11e9-9e0f-293afd261648.gif)

*Disable All Redirects*

> A handy toggle to disable all gateway redirects while keeping all other features enabled:

> ![redirect](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/157609/55317804-90452900-5471-11e9-9fc1-42bee5b15a6a.gif)

*Suspend IPFS Extension*

> The "power" icon can be used to temporarily suspend all IPFS integrations
> (redirects, API status, content scripts, protocol handlers etc).
> Useful during testing. Extension can be re-enabled with a single click:
>
> ![screenshot of suspend toggle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/157609/55317803-8fac9280-5471-11e9-96e3-f068cc62148b.gif)

*IPFS Status and Context Actions*

- IPFS API and Gateway status
- Add local (quick import) or remote files (context menu) to IPFS with option to preserve filename
- Easy access to [WebUI](https://github.com/ipfs/webui/) and add-on Preferences
- Toggle redirection to local gateway (automatic by default, manual mode can be enabled in Preferences)
- Additional actions for pages loaded from IPFS
    - Pin/Unpin of IPFS resources (via API)
    - Copy canonical IPFS address
    - Copy shareable URL to resource at preferred public gateway

*Install from Source*

To install it from source you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) `>=10.4.0` and
need [npm](npmjs.org) `>=6.1.0` installed. This uses [`node-gyp`](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) so **you must take a look** at their [platform specific dependencies](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation).

Then the follow the steps below to clone the source code, install the dependencies and run it the app:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop.git
cd ipfs-desktop
npm ci
npm start
```

The IPFS Desktop app will launch and should appear in your OS menu bar.

##### CLI, remote node and account managment
We have already studied how to use the CLI in [previos sections](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#cli-guide). What we need for this section is to understand that there is [a CLI guide](https://cybercongress.ai/docs/cyberd/ultimate-commands-guide/) and a guide for the CLI to be used with your [Ledger](https://cybercongress.ai/docs/cyberd/cyberd_ledger_guide/), it can be installed on any machine with one line and you can work with a remote node.

Creating an account takes 3 simple steps:

1) Open your terminal

2) Install the CLI with:

```
bash < <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cybercongress/go-cyber/master/scripts/install_cyberdcli_v0.1.6.sh)
```

3) Create a new account:

```
 cyberdcli keys add <your_key_name>
```

<your_key_name> is just any random key name you will remember. The system will ask you to add a password, do it.


3A) Alternatively, you can import an account, either by using a Cosmos/Cyber seed phrase:

```
cyberdcli keys add <your_key_name> --recover
```

Or via an ETH private key

```
 cyberdcli keys add private <your_key_name>
```

For all other manipulations and for understanding how to work with keys, check out our [CLI guide](https://cybercongress.ai/docs/cyberd/ultimate-commands-guide/).

##### Web2 theory
Web 2 is the preceded or of web3. I have numerous explanation on the web as to what it is. There are many other, great speakers describing their view of web3. However, I believe it is vital to understand web tech in general  (it's working, especially routing and beneficiaries) and the global problems web2 brings with its current architecture. 

- [Web2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0)
- [What are web 2 and 3: notes](https://github.com/serejandmyself/Presentations/blob/master/English/Web3/Web%203%20-%20BlockGeeks.pdf). Here I suggest you stop and check out the tech that builds the web in general. I will let you decide for yourself what to check, the options are endless.

##### IBC
To be continued

### Hardware
This is more of a theoretical section. I want to discuss the infrastructure behind cyber. Its heroes or validators if you may. Let's try to understand what they do and why they are so important to the success of the ecosystem, what computations they do and how does cyber work as a distributed supercomputer.

#### A hard day in the life of a Hero
Cybers infrastructure is managed by its heroes, the validators of Cyber. think of cyber is a huge super-intelligent, distributed computer with lots of computational power. It can answer questions, build an open semantics field and obtain knowledge. All in a decentralized manner. Behind the scenes, heroes do their work. In the [previous sections](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#nut_and_bolt-section-subtitle-mama-im-an-engineer) we already discussed why you should become a hero and what is required for it. Let's talk about this from a more technical angle, so we understand the work behind the scenes.

(Part of the text are borrowed from [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos/blob/master/VALIDATORS_FAQ.md) and other resources)

The role of validators is to run a full-node and participate in consensus by broadcasting votes which contain cryptographic signatures signed by their private key. Validators commit new blocks in the blockchain and receive revenue in exchange for their work. They must also participate in governance by voting on proposals. Validators are weighted according to their total stake. 

A full-node is a program that fully validates transactions and blocks of a blockchain. It is distinct from a light-node that only processes block headers and a small subset of transactions. Running a full-node requires more resources than a light-node but is necessary in order to be a validator. In practice, running a full-node only implies running a non-compromised and up-to-date version of the software with low network latency and without downtime. Of course, it is possible and encouraged for any user to run full-nodes even if they do not plan to be validators.
 
Participants in the network can signal that they want to become a validator by sending a “declare-candidacy” transaction, where they must fill out the following parameters:

- Validator's PubKey: The validator must signal an account with which it will perform its validator duties. The private key associated with PubKey is used to sign prevotes and precommits. This way, validators can have different accounts for validating and holding liquid funds.
- Validator's name
- Initial commission rate: The commission rate on block provisions, block rewards and fees charged to delegators
- Maximum commission: The maximum commission rate which this validator candidate can charge
- Commission change rate: The maximum daily increase of the validator candidate commission
- Minimum self-bond amount: Minimum amount of Atoms the validator candidate need to have bonded at all time. If the validator's self-bonded stake falls below this limit, its entire staking pool will unbond.
- Initial self-bond amount: Initial amount Atoms the validator candidate wants to self-bond

Validators, and by association delegators, receive block provisions, block rewards, fee rewards, and the right to participate in governance. If a validator misbehaves, a certain portion of its total stake is slashed (the severity of the penalty depends on the type of misbehaviour). This means that every user that bonded CYB to this validator gets penalized in proportion to its stake. Delegators are therefore incentivized to delegate to validators that they anticipate will function safely.

Validators should expect to provide one or more data center locations with redundant power, networking, firewalls, HSMs and servers. Validators should expect to perform regular software updates to accommodate upgrades and bug fixes. There will inevitably be issues with the network early in its bootstrapping phase that will require substantial vigilance.

Denial-of-service attacks occur when an attacker sends a flood of internet traffic to an IP address to prevent the server at the IP address from connecting to the internet. An attacker scans the network, tries to learn the IP address of various validator nodes and disconnect them from communication by flooding them with traffic.

One recommended way to mitigate these risks is for validators to carefully structure their network topology in a so-called sentry node architecture. Validator nodes should only connect to full-nodes they trust because they operate them themselves or are run by other validators they know socially. A validator node will typically run in a data center. Most data centres provide direct links the networks of major cloud providers. The validator can use those links to connect to sentry nodes in the cloud. This shifts the burden of denial-of-service from the validator's node directly to its sentry nodes and may require new sentry nodes be spun up or activated to mitigate attacks on existing ones.

Sentry nodes can be quickly spun up or change their IP addresses. Because the links to the sentry nodes are in private IP space, an internet-based attacked cannot disturb them directly. This will ensure validator block proposals and votes always make it to the rest of the network.

It is expected that good operating procedures on that part of validators will completely mitigate these threats.

The hard work pays off, of course, but you should understand that Cyber need a lot of power to compute general-purpose knowledge. Right now, the network might not be big, but it grows. The more cyberlinks, the more power is needed to process them. Also, remember that validators secure the network economically too. And this place more pressure on them.

#### Distributed supercomputer for general-purpose knowledge
This topic is crazy big. If you have read at least some of the papers in the learning curve above, you have a good understanding of how computers and distributed computers work. You should also have an understanding of how big and important is the task of processing knowledge and building an open semantics field.

In short, computers are relying on 3 whales: computation, storage and bandwidth to operate. Without these 3, a computer isn't really a computer. At least for the time being...

We call Cyber a supercomputer because it fulfils these requirements.

- Computation: Cyber is computed by validators. These are powerful machines that use their GPUs and memory to process the knowledge graph, rank and index the content and make sure that the network functions as it should. They openly do this in terms of running a shared and an open database that is in consensus about time and is deterministic. For now cyber is defined with 146 validators, but this number could increase if needs arise
- Bandwidth: Cyber is built on the idea that bandwidth is one of the hearts of the protocol. Cyber has a resource credit model and all the tx are done via this bandwidth that acts as a spam protection mechanism and as a market mediator. One of the principal goals of this model is to reduce the daily network growth to a given constant. This is done to accommodate heroes (validators) with the ability to forecast any future investment into infrastructure 
- Storage: Storage in cyber is defined by the storage that the nodes hosting IPFS, or any other protocols used by cyber, provides. In the future, we plan to add incentives and to integrate Urbit to make this a more native and a better functioning market

Cyber isn't a computer. It's a network of relevance machines, able to prove subjective relevance to one another and use this to build amazing predictive models. This opens up the market for all the [possible usecases](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#usecases). For a deeper understanding of our state of the art computer, please see our [white paper](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPjbx76LycfzSSWMcnni6YVvV3UNhTrYzyPMuiA9UQM3x).

## :pill: Section subtitle: The deep space
> Oh well... It's deep space now. No more Milky Way. Strange planets around you. You are a billion light-years away from Earth

This section will dive into the undived. We will talk about the things that were left out before. The deep library of cyber. Some parts of this section might sound a bit crazy, some... not as crazy.

### Questions

<details>
  <summary>Why open-source? </summary>
Because open-source technology is the future way of communication between projects, users and developers. Open-source doesn't stop at referencing to technological progress. Open-source is a new way to collaborate. It allows people to freely change, commit to and modify ideas. And as a result, help progress and innovation at a higher temp and in a more secure manner.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Are you Satoshi? </summary>
We wish... And we don't. We wish we were so smart and to have the knowledge of whomever Satoshi was/were/ is/are... We do not wish because knowing who Satoshi is, would destroy the whole idea of Satoshi.
</details>

<details>
  <summary> Why are you so geeky?</summary>
Why not? Geeky is the new cool. Geeks are awesome. If you didn't notice the world has been ruled by Geeks since the Microsoft made it to the top. In the last century, geeks have been all around us. From Facebook to google.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>I read one of your manifests, are you crazy? </summary>
I would lie if I said we weren't. But doesn't it take a bit of craziness, abstract geniuses and adventurism to change the world? Knowledge is a vital virtue that we possess. But if we were normal, we wouldn't be any different from the rest.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why do you talk so much about values? </summary>
Because values are what spins the world around. Our values lay at the core of the technology that we have created. Those values are the driver of that innovation. They are the goal. The technology is the instrument to get there.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why all species? </summary>
Because all species should (and will) have an equal opportunity for secure and transparent communication.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How can all species be intelligent? </summary>
Intelligence can be simplified to communication. All species can communicate via electromagnetic impulses (including robots). If they can communicate (which they can), they can prove their existence and pass on a signal and receive an answer. This is intelligence at its most pure form.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why do you need all those manifests/researches? How does it help the project? </summary>
We think that it is stupid to achieve any goals without understanding the problem you are trying to solve. Daily, all around the world, people do something... But why do just something, when you can do THE something that needs to be done and that solves the problem you or someone else were trying to solve? We believe that all of this can, and will, help the project as it evolves trust in what we do. Shows that we have an understanding of what and why we do it. And that we are ready to prove the world that it will help to fix broken protocols for the better.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How is this AI related? </summary>
First, what is AI? AI is the intelligence demonstrated by a machine. This doesn't necessarily mean that the machine must be from the year 12255 (by then, it will probably be a world of machines as it is).

In its essence cyber is a huge distributed consensus computer, it is a dynamic protocol that is influenced by different machines and users simultaneously. It learns from actions. It can prune things that are irrelevant to it. It can prove the relevance of any two existing objects that are known to it.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do you plan to take over the world/internet? </summary>
By showcasing and awesome product and with the help of the community behind it. Of course, those are loud words. But our product is working. The idea has proved to be functioning and has a proved and a cemented market demand. We are experimenting, but we are an experienced team. We have the knowledge, the understanding and the passion to drive this product forward. In combination with the product itself, the code, the community, the donations, the DAO, and everything else - it will either happen (the taking over)... or it won't. Either way, we will do everything to make this happen!
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is this religious? </summary>
Yes. By all means, it is. It is the most anti-religious techno-religion in the wild.
</details>

<details>
  <summary> What is your main target audience?</summary>
Our main TA are internet users. We plan to concentrate on developers, IPFS users, crypto maniacs and like-minded people at the beginning. We then, want to concentrate on younger generations. We firmly believe that they can grasp what we do (including our values) better than anyone else.
</details>

### The evolution of species
> The cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff. We are a way for the universe to know itself
Carl Sagan

The making of cyber has a lot put behind it. I could Theoretically go straight to the point (and if you are eager to know more, simply skip to the next section), but I think it is vital to state that values are what keeps the world spinning around (or rather what keeps it from spinning around the wrong way).

We do not believe in captchas. We do not believe in KYC. We do not believe in licensing and any other similar to the above-mentioned bullshit. We do believe in code. We believe in innovation and in making use of our knowledge to make the world a slightly better place for our children.

With that in mind, what I'm trying to say, is that cyber and cyb are not just technological results. They are much more. At its base lay the values of the team behind cyber. We hope that our project can re-create certain values of what we believe the blockchain paradigm stands for. 

Some of these ideas might seem crazy to you. Some you might completely disagree with. And that's good. We don't expect anyone to fully agree with what we do. Please remember that the ideas outlined below belong to cyber~Congress, cyber is a separate entity governed by cyber ~foundation. However, as a DAO those ideas drive us forward and we feel that it is necessary to share them with the public for transparency. 

#### The manifest
The most difficult thing about a freedom manifest is making it not as a manifest. This was rightly pointed out by @sparky. As the work with manifests and everything related to it is not as vital as launching cyber, we do not, currently, spend much time on it. However you may find the occasional pull request in that direction and if you are willing to help, [feel free to do so](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/pulls).

Our Mission is to help the evolution of species!

Over 40 years ago, Earth launched Voyager 1 and 2 into deep space. Until today, this mission [is ongoing](https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status/) and keeps uniting us as species and gives all of us hope. With the Voyagers, our species sent the [golden record](https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/golden-record/whats-on-the-record/) to space, assembled out of 115 images and a variety of natural sounds, such as those made by surf, wind and thunder, birds, whales, and other animals. To this, they added musical selections from different cultures and eras and spoken greetings from Earth-people in fifty-five languages.

That record carries what we believe in, with this, below, we have outlined the goals and values that we believe in the most. This is a hard mission, as our foremost wish is freedom and outlining anything when speaking of freedom is hard.

Blockchain technology has opened the opportunity for development which was previously impossible.

The great John Lenon once said:
`Imagine there's no countries`
`Nothing to kill or die for`
`And no religion, too`
`You may say I'm a dreamer`
`I hope someday you'll join us`
`And the world will be as one`

Those words are not kept to their original order, but they still carry the same message that we share.

We have goals and values. Most of our goals we recreate into general issues on our roadmap. from there, you may follow any of these and see how they break down into tasks and overgo an evolution until there is a result. 

Most of our goals and values overlap. Some of them can be expresses as a reference to movies, songs, poetry, academic research. Some are easier listed:

- Security: We do not work with fiat and avoid bureaucratic paper hassle. We prefer to work with digital signatures
- Anonymity and privacy: If someone chooses to stay anonymous or private, it is their right to do so. We respect it
- Open-source software: Everything we release into production should be open-source and auditable
- Open-source hardware: Every piece of hardware that goes into production, should be open-sourced and auditable
- Transparency: We believe that transactional transparency is fundamental to building decentralized communities
- Informational freedom: Local laws should not prohibit data flow and information
- Economic freedom: Nobody should prevent or block public transactions
- Free will: We reject corporate slavery bullshit, such as conflict of interest or NDA
- Capital, not salary: Helping to switch from dragging to the bottom salary to a capital-based, passive income for species 
- Engineering is marketing: We would rather spend our resources on engineering than on marketing
- Physical liberty: Limitations to physical liberty can be economic, but not authoritative
- Automation: Everything that can be automated, should be automated
- Intelligence: An entity can be treated as intelligent if they can provably communicate
- Decentralization: Everything that can be decentralized, shall be decentralized
- Always on the edge: We try to offer alternatives to outdated technologies such as emails

By sharing those values we want to show what drives us. What makes our inner clocks tick. Those values unite us. If you check out the project `roadmap`, you will find a list of episodes, ranging from I - V. These [episodes](https://github.com/orgs/cybercongress/projects/2), as already mentioned, include our goals. 

They can be grouped into the following categories:

- Science: building a strong scientific foundation, space exploration, technologies that can transfer human conciseness, extend living capabilities, improve ecology (thermoregulation) 
- Development: improving consensus computers, developing interfaces, integrating post-quantum cryptography, independent robots, open tools for biological engineering, develop metaverse    
- Economy: achieving an incentivized system for all types of actors, self-sustainability, access to equal economics to all species, creating incentives for AI
- Transparency: providing access to transactions, lack of censorship, demolishing borders and states
- Privacy: a possibility for private communication
- Governance: finding replacements for control, open unified registries
- Social: abolishing fear, freedom of choice, bringing sociology and anthropology back to natural ways

Below is one of the most important quotes ever said on Earth by Carl Sagan:

“Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.” ― Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space

We share this vision, but we look forward and even beyond it.

We understand that technicalities are boring, but we want to be transparent. To achieve our goals we will utilize any type of appropriate to our values technology that either exists or create it ourselves. 

May the code be with you. Don't believe. Don't fear. Don't ask!

#### R&D
We prefer a scientific approach to guessing. Hence R&D makes for a large part of our values and goals as a DAO. Currently, there aren't many public research cases that we have published. Our fields of research include:

- Cybernomics (economy and crypto): 
  - [cyber](https://github.com/cybercongress/go-cyber). Status: Working. Bounties
  - [Research library by @hipster](https://github.com/xhipster/cybernomics). Status: Ongoing.
- Hardware: 
  - [cyber~Labs](https://github.com/cyblabs). Status: Open
- Communications of interspecies: 
  - [Deep Bidirectional Transformers](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/research/knowledge%20graph/Deep%20Bidirectional%20Transformers%20(working%20name).md). Status: Open. Bounty 

All our research is done by using open-source instruments. We only start research if we understand the architecture of the solution and can implement it into a working product. Most of our research is sponsored via bounties. 

We will continue to do research and publish and implement results into working products, hoping for the help and support of cyber~Foundation for future funding, ideas and implementations. 

### Usecases
There are many ways to describe cyber. In its simplest form, it is a computer for answers. But that leaves a lot of ambiguity as to what this can be used for. 

It is quite difficult to break these by topis as they are all interconnected. Hence, for now, I am not sure how to separate them for easier reading. 

Also, please remember that the below cases are true as of today - partially. Some of them contain my imagination, that requires certain technological implementations.

*Web3 browsers*:
We have [already built one - Cyb](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb). What should be understood, as that Cyb is a personal search application with an inbuilt search engine and another ton of features (like personal robots, the ability to transact, etc). It is your personal app on top of an objective database of knowledge, without any custodial restrictions or any adverts (unless you want to implement them for yourself). What's more important, is that it lacks web2 bullshit. And... you can make your own browser/s on top of Cyber if you have the skills (you can also customize Cyb).

*Personal robots*:
When you start up Cyb, the protocol creates a robot tied to your private key. He is your personal demiurge. He studies with you, helps you, guides you. But he is much more. And he does not have to be alone. In theory, such robots can be taught anything you want them to know. For example: he can be taught semantics related to your trading over the years, follow your trades, study the related papers that you read. This will create a unique trading robot, just yours and only yours. Just imagine what else can a robot be used for if it has access to your knowledge. In theory, with the help of second layer semantics, we can teach robots emotions. I.E. - this cyberlink makes me sad. That cyberlink makes me happy, etc. This allows a robot to give you the content that you want. It allows him to share it, if you want, with others, it allows him to study you - creating things that are way beyond imagination right now. 

*Personal assistant*:
It is not simply a robot, it is an assistant that with the help of certain instruments can help you to evolve, predict your behaviour (let's assume that you allow it to study DNA) and help to teach children, help them to evolve, etc. This is not "I know kong-fu" in 2 seconds, but its the right path in that direction.

*Database access*:
Cyber gives you the ability to access your database of knowledge. Theoretically, create a personal knowledge graph and query it. This means no more losing information. Less time to study a subject. And so on.

*Basic income*:
Such a robot can help to solve 2 problems (a) personal data reselling - if you want to sell it, you decide to do so. (b) the above is just one example of how to produce basic income. In theory personal data, trading robots, content robots, oracle mechanism - they all can provide a human with a basic passive income. This solves a world-renowned issue!

*Gamification*:
There are plenty of examples of how this can be introduced and used. One is, of course, an application that allows personal robots to battle one another and earn rewards. 

*Education*:
Cyber can easily become the main, unbiased and uncontrolled resource for **relevant** information. This is important. Information is dynamic. It evolves. Meaning that a person will have access to relevant information without any intermediary opinions. 

*Programmable (or natural) semantics*:
With the help of Cyber, you can structure search results and target specific semantics cores and index apps as you wish if you were a programmer. If you are a user though, Cyber gives us the ability to literally, re-create the semantics of the web. We communicate with the help of semantics, hence, such communications have been evolving unnaturally due to restrictions and limitations from search engines. considering that search engines contain all that we know as humans, then this is not ok. Cyber lets users and engineers fix this. 

*Create a complicated matrix*:
Google is a genius instrument. Google has all the people on earth working for free and creating a semantically structured centralised database. One of the major issues is that Google does this without using the resources at your disposal (let alone the centralised database and working for free). This means that the semantic matrix that we can create has a restriction. By using all the resources in your possession we can create complicated semantical matrixes around us, helping us to study, evolve and understand things.

*Earn reards*:
As simple as this sounds. It is. Simply cyberlink what is important to you and earn rewards by staking. 

*Intercommunication knowledge graphs*:
All species on earth can have a separate knowledge graph. Any species can intake and output an electromagnetic impulse - hence communicate, therefore - it is intelligent. Meaning that we might not be able to talk directly about our day with other species. But, all species can understand basic behaviour mechanisms - survival, breed, fighting, etc. This means that if each species will have an own knowledge graph, then with the help of second layer semantics and some basic ML algorithms we can create inter-species communications...

*Search actions*: 
It is important to have applications that can transact and can prove those transactions. Cyber allows for several crypto-related powers to emerge. Such as: with the help of wrappers, be able to view balances, send transactions, sign messages, etc. Basically, manage your portfolio if you have the right tools in place. With the help of basic algorithms, the ability to search and analyze blockchains and tangles will allow for many possibilities to study protocols, study behaviour, transactions, and so on. This can help protocols to study and understand computation, resources wastage, bandwidth problems and so on. In theory, Cyber can allow for cross-chain, semantically-backed transactions sometime in the future. This idea is mind-blowing. 

*Off-line search*: 
IPFS makes it possible to easily retrieve a document from such an environment without a global internet connection. cyberd itself can be distributed by using IPFS. This creates the possibility for ubiquitous, off-line search! 

*Command tools*: 
Command-line tools can rely on relevant and structured answers from a search engine. Searching from within CLI tools will inevitably create a highly competitive market of a dedicated semantic core for robots.

*Autonomous robots*: 
Cyber offers a minimalistic, but a continuously self-improving data source, which provides the necessary tools for programming economically rational robots. With the help of IoT integrations and basic networking tools, we can create robots that make decisions based upon a well studied and structured semantic database (knowledge graph).

*Language convergence*: 
A dream of a truly global language is hard to deploy because it is hard to agree on what means what. However, we have the tools to make this dream come true. A programmer should not care about what language will an agent be using. The entire UTF-8 spectrum is at work. The semantic core is open, so competition for answering queries can become distributed across different domain-specific areas, including the semantic cores for various languages. 

*Self prediction and risk management*:
Cyber can analyze its state based on a huge internal knowledge database that is constantly evolving. What's more interesting is that a consensus computer can continuously build a knowledge graph on its own, predicting the existence of cyberlinks and applying these predictions to its state. This means that we can create rather crazy things, for example: risk management instruments, war predictions, economic failure or success predictions, etc. 

*Universal oracle*: 
A consensus computer can store the most relevant data in a key-value storage, where the key is a CID and the values are the bytes of the actual content. To compute utility measure, validators check the availability and the size of the content for the top-ranked content addresses within the knowledge graph, then, weight on the size of the CIDs and its rank. Values could be used in programs. If we try to imagine what this can lead to, then we can come up with the unimaginable. One such example can be a local or a universal program that can be used to reach local consensus for something that could not have been reached before. This is based on the fact that the analysis happens on data, that is based on the true will of the agents. 

*Universal emotional mechanism*:
In theory, combined with your personal robot that has been semantically thought emotions, we have the option to speak to our mind. We can analyze all the data that we been studying for years and query it. For example, an agent was linking for many years, something with the emotion of happiness. By such, this agent can query all the happiness results and then a local community can follow and do the same (each one for himself). Thereafter a local (or on a larger scale) community can choose to share those results between each other and analyze what can be implemented as a suited, organic and a natural happiness mechanism for this particular community, etc.

*Proof of location*:
It is possible to construct cyberlinks with 'proof-of-location', consequently, a location-based search can also become provable, if web3-agents will mine triangulations and attach ‘proof of location’ for every linked chain. Apart from the obvious, this can create digital registers, digital land tokens and even digital countries within geo-space. 

*Proof of web3-agent*: 
Content can be tied with an agent via a private key if that content is on the knowledge graph. This can help to create meaningful air-drops and help for wealth distribution via the use of provable links.

*Natural anthropology*:
If Cyber grows, then it will be easy to connect with like-minded people and build communities with them. With the help of semantics and the knowledge graph, it will be enough, to just press "find people like me" button, and without giving away any information - it will.

*Amazing social networks*:
To continue the above thought, if a person does not want to connect physically, just imagine the on-line possibilities this can create. This will allow for naturally created social networks, with like-minded people, based on knowledge, interests and so on. A network where you talk to people that you want. Maybe in VR. Maybe on a digital piece of land. Without revealing who you are, if you don't want to. Peers will still be able to prove relevance to one another! 

*Motivation for read requests*:
It would be great to create cybernomics not only for ‘write’ requests to consensus computers but from ‘read’ requests too. Thus, read requests can become orders of magnitude cheaper but still guaranteed. Read requests to a search engine can be provided by the second tier of nodes which earn CYB tokens within state channels. We consider implementing state channels based on HTLC and proof of verification, which unlocks the number of tokens earned for already served requests.

*Prediction markets on link relevance and beyond*:
An application that allows betting on link relevance can become a unique source of truth for the direction of terms. This can create a whole new prediction market. And not only for links but for anything semantically related. Why prediction markets? Because they are (currently) the perfect example of a peer to peer transactional behaviour, meaning that a variety of such markets can help local economies to evolve.

*File-hosting*
File hosting is a huge market. Memory, in terms of disk space, is something we all possess. Several projects in the space are working on solving the issue. We believe that a ranking mechanism can improve search over disk space by a mile. For example, it can introduce more security in terms of seeing which content is ranked higher and which nodes are more trustworthy. Along with our other ideas, like Karma points (for linking) and Urbit integration into the project, it is safe to say that cyber can become a major player on the file-hosting market. 

### Subculture
Cyber has and is building its own subculture. We believe that the idea of gamification and a sense of belonging are 2 vital parts of success for a product. 

In the glossary of the colonization section, you will find terms with their description. 

We will continue to build upon the subculture, utilizing not just naming like heroes, masters, etc. But, connect these ideas to implementations. For example karma points, which are a simple way of measuring the contributions to a knowledge graph via introducing a reputation system. 

In the future, we plan on implementing NFTs, robot wars, levels and other gamication elements.

## :milky_way: Section subtitle: Colonization
> We finally made it to our destination, cyber~Space (or whatever else you want to call it)...

This section will talk about some of the things you will need to know for colonizing deep space planets. In places, it might go over things you already know. It is better to think of this section as a bibliography or maybe even a reference for those who managed to finish the previous levels or just curious to find out certain things

### FAQ for the wicked

<details>
  <summary>What is cyber? </summary>
Cyber is a decentralized google. An innovative search protocol. A distributed computer for answers. A consensus-driven, superintelligence. A relevance machine that can predict things, based on knowledge.  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is cybers mission? </summary>
Cybers mission is to create a universal search protocol to (a) build an open semantic field of the internet with the help of blockchain technology and cyberlinks, and (b) decentralize the infrastructure of the web with the help of blockchain
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How are you planning to achieve it? </summary>
By showcasing and awesome product and with the help of the community behind it. Of course, those are loud words. But our product is working. The idea has proved to be functioning and has a proved and cemented market demand. We are experimenting, but we are an experienced team. We have the knowledge, the understanding and the passion to drive this product forward. In combination with the product itself, the code, the community, the donations, the DAO, and everything else, it will either happen (the taking over)... or it won't. Either way, we will do everything to make this happen!
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is cyber private? </summary>
Cyber is privacy orientated but it doesn't have privacy technology implemented. This means that there are no private on-chain smart contracts and no, real, private transactions. However, transactions are hashed and no user tracking is happening behind the scenes. In fact, there is no "behind the scenes", as the protocol is user-driven and 100% open source. In the future, we plan to implement privacy by design. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is cyber a P2P tech? </summary>
Not exactly. It is in the sense that users are interacting peer to peer with their computers, without a company in the middle. However, technically a blockchain is also an intermediary. What's good, is that you don't need to trust a blockchain thanks to how it functions.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why and how do you use blockchain? </summary>
We use Tendermint as an engine that helps the network to reach agreement on its current state, perform transactions on the blockchain, validate search results, etc. In other words, we use the blockchain as a trustless, distributed database that can verify things. We also use blockchain to implement tokens and economic incitive for the above reasons. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Briefly, what other tech do you use and why? </summary>
We use IPFS as the internet to our search protocol. In the future, we plan to implement more "internets". We use CUDA for computation. It can also be said that users use different hardware to perform different computations. We use Aragon for DAO implementations. We use hardware wallets and extensions for interaction with our protocol. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How is cyber better than google? </summary>
It's more efficient. It isn't prone to regulations. It's not a blackbox. It works for you and not the other way around. It provides economic incentives. It's trustless. Its governed and owned by users. It expresses your opinion and not someone else. It has plenty of other use cases, that are not search-related. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How is cyber different from Tor? </summary>
Tor is not a search protocol. Tor is a highly efficient privacy instrument. Tor does not provide economic incentives. Tor doesn't use the blockchain. Tor does not answer questions. we see Tor as an instrument that we could provide a search protocol for. We hope that Tor can implement cyber on an application-level one day.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Isn't this just another YACY? </summary>
YACY (and other P2P similar mechanisms) have plenty of years of work behind their backs, which cyber (still) hasn't. YACY is pure P2P, cyber isn't. It has a blockchain between the users. Also those years of work which YACY and the others have, kind of proven that they don't work. Otherwise, we would not be making cyber. Obviously, YACY doesn't have any of the features, described above, that cyber has (economic incentives, DAOs, consensus, owned by the users, etc).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>There are other IPFS-based searches! Why is this different? </summary>
All other IPFS searches are mere crawlers, meaning they just look for something that was already in IPFS and (might) return an answer, some even do. Cyber is a protocol. Cyber itself is a blockchain with all of the above-mentioned pros. Cyber can crawl IPFS and any other protocol (if added). Think of this like this: crawling is looking for an existing needle on an existing football field. You don't know whether or not that needle is the one you been looking for. You cannot add another needle if you think that needle looks wrong. You cant change the needle to anything else. Cyber lets users build an open semantics field. This means that you can enrich every square meter of the football field with appropriate words. Including the square meter where the needle was, with the word "sharp" or/and "needle", etc. You can start using these semantics to build apps around it. Every time you find a needle, call a cleaner. You may start earning on that action. Comparing cyber to a crawler is like comparing a drawing of a car to a real car. they might look similar and have the same name. But it's 2 completely different things.  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How is cyber special? </summary>
That depends in comparison to what. In general, cyber is governed by cyber~Foundation, which is a community DAO with its own pot of funds. This means that cyber isn't owned by anyone. Cyber also has many crazy, possible use cases, which open up as part of the creation of the open semantic field. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What can you show to prove that cyber works? </summary>
First of all, cyber.page, the gateway app. Go on and explore it. Check out the masters part of this doc to see how to use it and what it can do. There is the GitHub code for those who can read it. We have numerous apps and extensions, like the vesting, evangelism and the auction Aragon apps. And there is cyb~Virus, the browser extension. Work is undergoing on the metamask snap for all cosmos based chains and, of course, on cyb, the real web3 personal, on-chain, browser application that will take everything to the next level. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are your values as a team? </summary>
Decentralization, open-source, globality, lack of bureaucracy. Security. Anonymity for those who choose to be anonymous. Transparency, informational freedom, free will. We build for the future. We do not believe in KYC. We do not believe in censorship and enforcement. We do not think that something magically happens by itself 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Who controls cyber? </summary>
No one or rather everyone. Our idea is to design a tool where everyone feels equal. With that said, this can defiantly act like a competitive instrument. Someone who posses more tokens can link content (and hence rank it) with more weight.  The purpose of the tool is to share and access information freely. The amount of tokens in possession does not influence this virtue and does not abuse the protocol. On the contrary, someone with more tokens, committing to the knowledge graph, is bound to make it more relevant. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Who will own cyber? </summary>
Please see above. cyber~Foundation will govern cyber. Which means that the stakeholders decide on what will happen via governance mechanisms. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How will cyber be governed? </summary>
Via a decentralised autonomous organisation, called cyber~Foundation. The foundation DAO is Aragon-bred and, for now, live in ETH.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why cyber, its just a buzz word... </summary>
We've been using the word cyber for about 10 years. Cyber refers to anything that is very smart. The meaning is rooted in the word cybernetics (check out the article on Wikipedia) - a science which describes the behaviour of dynamic systems with feedback loops. We hope to make cyber a verb and not a noun. Where it will mean to look for something clever. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why so many buzzwords? </summary>
We don't think we use buzzwords. We implement technology that is working and in some places it is popular. But that just means that we are using the best that there is out there. We don't use or say something unless we have implemented it in one way or another.  The term buzzwords can be applied to those who use a certain term for the sake of buzz. We use these terms because we actually have the tech implemented and its rather hard to describe a table, without using the word itself or its virtues. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why is linking important? </summary>
Hyperlinks shape the internet. They have built it. We base our knowledge, our political, economic and educational decisions on the internet. We learn from google. google is our father, teacher, source of knowledge, social life, etc. But, how can we trust the internet if it was shaped by something that itself is untrusted? Well, we can't. Cyberlinks, on the other hand, are trusted and backed by a provable and an auditable mechanism that anyone can check. This means that with the aid of cyberlinks we can, no less, but create a trusted model of all the information in the universe!
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is there censorship? </summary>
Nope... Not on the protocol level. Not on the database level. Not on the consensus level. Every transaction should and must be routed (passed to its destination whatever it may be).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is cyber privacy orientated? </summary>
Yes. This has been answered in previous questions. However, this calls for "breaking the law" questions. If we obscure from the question of what is the law and by whom it is determined, then: There are no bad intentions in wanting to find the answer to something. You might not know something is "bad" until you know what it is. We are born Tabula Rasa - a clean sheet. The answer itself might indeed contain information that someone might see as "bad" or "inappropriate". This is not something we can control. We do not produce the information, we provide the tool to search through it and obtain it.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are the use-cases of cyber? </summary>
There is a whole section of this document dedicated to answering that. The most obvious are: web3 browsers, decentralized knowledge graphs, personal robots, basic income, games, SEO, education, off-line search, self prediction, education, universal oracles, etc
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's cyber~Metagalaxy? </summary>
The cyber~Metagalaxy is the name for all of cybers apps, entities, repos, etc together. Think of it as the big picture. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do you get rewards in cyber? </summary>
As a validator, you get rewarded for securing the network and you can get a commission from delegators. As a user, you may delegate to a validator and be eligible for rewards. As a user, you may take advantage of semantics and web3 just as you would in web2, but without the third party and earn rewards. As an evangelist, you may earn rewards for spreading the love about cyber. As a developer, you may build things and receive rewards from the community pool, just like all other users can. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Who are heroes and masters? </summary>
Heroes are the validators that secure the network via their infrastructure. Masters are the builders of the Great Web, who use cyber by creating cyberlinks and building an open semantical field. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I monetize cyber? </summary>
You may create applications or take advantage of existing apps. Just as you would monetize content on web2 or just as you would build apps, provide a service, create a project, etc. All of this is possible in cyber. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How many tokens are there? </summary>
There are 2 tokens. CYB is the native token of the system and is used for security and bandwidth. THC is used as a governance token in our Ethereum DAO. There is 1 PCYB of tokens (and growing). And 700 TTHC. That's a lot, we know. There is also an internal "token",  karma, which is your reputation for building the web. It cannot be transferred. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Are there any bounties? </summary>
Yes. We have gifted 10% of our supply to over 1 million ETH, ATOM and Urbit addresses. Also, we have an OBEP program for cyber evangelists, that can earn bounties.  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I become an ambassador? </summary>
You need to apply on cyber.page by submitting a transaction from your Ledger device. Then, you will get blessed by cyber~Congress and you can start your evangelism journey.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why do you need GPUs? </summary>
We use GPU to make, rather, complex computations. Validators use GPUs to calculate the rank of cyberlinks, which helps to index the search results at any given moment.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>When will you launch a mainnet? </summary>
Roughly, autumn 2020. The mainnet will be launched after the end of one of our distribution games final, the Game of Links. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is it safe to use now? </summary>
It is safe to search, link and do anything else you normally would. However, cyber has not been audited professionally yet. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why is this so hard? </summary>
It's not hard. It's complex. Anything new requires lots and lots of explanation, until it too, becomes familiar, just like the usual things. However, we are trying to build something innovative and this requires us to explain things from scratch. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why so much information? </summary>
Becomes cyber consists of a lot of pieces. This follows best practises in terms of modular computing. With it, the protocol isn't actually heavy and is described in the white paper in a few steps. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why open-source? </summary>
Because open-source technology is the future way of communication between projects, users and developers. Open-source doesn't stop at referencing to technological progress. Open-source is a new way to collaborate. It allows people to freely change, commit to and modify ideas. And as a result, help progress and innovation at a higher temp and in a more secure manner.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I use cyber? </summary>
Go to cyber.page, open the master section of this document (search for it with Cntrl F or just go to the required section) and learn how to use cyber. Its fairly easy at this stage and will become easier as we progress. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How is cyber web3? </summary>
Web 3 is the direct communication between peers, nodes and other actors of similar, lacking a central authority, networks. In these networks, peers are motivated economically and are in consensus about what they do. Cyber is just that with a utility, the ability to deliver answers. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's wrong with web2? </summary>
Centralisation, lack of care for security, very few beneficiaries, data loss, data selling and re-selling, etc. Web2 has come to a stale point and needs a change. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why do you need donation rounds? </summary>
Each donation round has serves a separate task. The takeoff donation round is aimed at early believers and is for cyber~Congress DAO. The second round is aimed at early speculators and to gain traction amongst good projects. The third donation round is aimed at cyber~Foundation and is for the protocol. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is this a religion? </summary>
Yes. By all means, it is. It is the most anti-religious techno-religion in the wild.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Who is the target audience? </summary>
Our main TA are internet users. We plan to concentrate on developers, IPFS users, crypto maniacs and like-minded people at the beginning. We then, want to concentrate on younger generations. We firmly believe that they can grasp what we do (including our values) better than anyone else.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How will you reach them? </summary>
The initial TA is planned to be reached with an MVP/SCL and a working product. The next step is reached by prooving that cyber provides hope to users.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Are you crazy? </summary>
I would lie if I said we weren't. But doesn't it take a bit of craziness, abstract geniuses and adventurism to change the world? Knowledge is a vital virtue that we possess. But if we were normal, we wouldn't be any different from the rest.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How is this AI-related? </summary>
First, what is AI? AI is the intelligence demonstrated by a machine. This doesn't necessarily mean that the machine must be from the year 12255 (by then, it will probably be a world of machines as it is).
In its essence cyber is a huge distributed consensus computer, it is a dynamic protocol that is influenced by different machines and users simultaneously. It learns from actions. It can prune things that are irrelevant to it. It can prove the relevance of any two existing objects that are known to it.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I fork it? </summary>
Go ahead. Seriously. We are open-source for a reason. You may copy, modify, do as you please. Our license agreement is this: Don’t believe, don’t fear, don’t ask.
Eventually, we will meet each other with the help of IBC or other instruments of the free market.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I build something on top of cyber? </summary>
You defiantly should! The idea of forking cyber is not just a call to action. It is a call for development. You may build your specialised search (knowledge graphs) that reference to our general-purpose knowledge graph. You may provide services on top of your own, or our knowledge graph and IPFS (services such as e-commerce, SEO, hosting, identity, etc).
You can also build personal knowledge graphs that can help you to learn or to build relevant and provable databases for any purposes.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Where do I start with cyber? </summary>
This document! 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>I don't get it, I'm still confused </summary>
I would advise you to read all of this document. Use issues to ask questions that you think were left unanswered.
In general, think of cyber as of a completely brand-new mechanism for obtaining answers. Of a software capable of building universal knowledge and communicating.
</details>

## :fireworks: Section subtitle: Landing completed
**Congratulations!** You are now a cyber~Cosmonaut and a have all the tools that you need to build the `Great Web`! We salute you for completing this journey. Help us to improve by learning how to submit a PR and find more links that will help you to survive out in the wild.

### Improving this document
We welcome and eagerly await new builders to help us prepare our spaceships for take-off. Its never been as easy, just do it - [sumbit a pull request with an improvement!](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/pulls)
A pull request is essentially a way to contribute to any open-source project on GitHub. Whilst we are not planning to teach you how to use GitHub, we strongly advise you to learn how to use both git and GitHub. It is fairly easy and simple and will be a great tool for you to add to your skills. Check out [this free guide](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners). Please note, that to submit a PR, you don't need to read over it, it's even simpler than you might think. 

1) Open your favourite, web2, browser, navigate to [github.com](https://github.com/), fill in the info and hit the `Sign up` button in the top right corner:
