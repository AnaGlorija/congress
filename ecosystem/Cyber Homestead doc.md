## :fuelpump: Section subtitle: Ground floor
Cosmonauts do not become who they are if the initial training isn't done properly. In this section, you will find out about some basic terminology that you will need to understand cyber, and dive right into some of its basics. Including the history of cyber, how it works, how to use it and our philosophy.

### Technical questions in plain terms
*Click on the below questions to expand the answer:*
<details>
  <summary> What are distributed technologies? </summary>
Distributed technologies are technologies that do not have a central source of power in terms of computing and storage. In terms of blockchains (distributed data ledgers), it is primarily referred to databases that are shared across multiple independent sources and have an agreement on the shared information at any point in time in those databases (are in consensus).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a consensus computer?</summary>
A consensus in computing refers to the process of different computers agreeing on some data and/or its value. For example, they might need to agree on the current time or whether or not Alice has 10 BTC (Bitcoins) on her account balance. So, a consensus computer is a computer that is involved in that process (usually used specifically and solely for that purpose).
  </details>
  
<details>
  <summary> What's a hash? </summary>
A hash means a reworking of old and familiar material. In computing, this refers to a bunch of symbols that represent a particular piece of information/data/file (more precisely, it authenticates the fact that the data represented is what it is). In other words, it is a `fingerprint`. 
I.E a sha256 hash of `cyber` is: `99100ac04db2147ef246377b1ea4fc0c17106d37286e5d61cc02201301a85bbb`. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary> What is a Merkle tree?</summary>
A Merkle tree is the name of a representation (an analogy if you may) of how some data (information) is structured (into a database). It is shaped like a tree, where there is one major root, from which others spawn and they are related to it. From those more branches/roots spawn out, until we get to the leaves, which represent the current upper level of the information. All the information can be traced from any point to any other point and is mathematically tied one to another.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a blockchain? </summary>
A blockchain is a distributed ledger into which independent participants write, and read from it - information. It is protected by the fact that it is distributed across participants computers, which are in agreement one with another at any point of a given time (past or present). A blockchain is auditable to anyone and transparent. This allows its participants to make sure that there is nothing shady happening in the background. Usually, data in blockchains is structured with the help of a Merkle tree or a Directed Acyclic Graph (more commonly knows as a DAG, which in very basic terms, is just a different way of structuring data). 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a transaction? </summary>
In terms of a blockchain, a transaction is a process of moving data. I.E. I have 10 dollars and pass them to your account. I made a transaction.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's a token? </summary>
A token in blockchain terms is a digital representation of some certain value, relating to a specific distributed ledger. It should contain some utility i.e. it should be used to do something, which in turn gives it value for the participants (users) of that ledger. It can be represented in several ways and there can be more than one token on one ledger. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is NFT? </summary>
NFT are non-fungible tokens. Meaning that they are tokens of one type, but each not interchangeable, each with their own characteristics. For example, a collectable stamp is an example of NFT. All stamps are... stamps. But each stamp has its own characteristics, value and history.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's bandwidth? </summary>
Bandwidth is the amount of information someone can pass through some resource at a given time frame. For example (which is a mere analogy), if I can move 5 stones from room A to room B in the space of one hour. Then we can say that my stone bandwidth is 5 stones per hour. Bandwidth in IT relates to information and the ability to pass a certain amount of data from one place to another.<br>
In cyber bandwidth plays a major role. It is a spam protection mechanism. It allows a user to only do a certain amount of transaction in a certain amount of time. Then, over time, it regenerates to give the user more ability to commit more transactions.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is Sybil resistance? </summary>
Sybil resistant means that it can withstand Sybil attacks. A Sybil attack is simply an attack on a system where the attacker uses a lot of pseudo (fake) identities to gain influence (usually, in terms of computational power) for himself.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is BFT? </summary>
FT is an abbreviation for Byzantine fault tolerance. It is a system that tackles the Byzantine general problem (a problem in which 4 generals need to come to an agreement of successfully attacking a city at the same time). In blockchains, each node (computer) needs to agree with one another on the current state of the network securely and efficiently. BFT is designed in such a way to help avoid the Byzantine generals problem. It is designed to achieve agreement even if some of the communicating nodes involved act maliciously. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary> What is POS? </summary>
Proof of Stake is the name of the consensus algorithm (way of agreeing) that is used in certain blockchain systems. Its main idea is to protect the system through the use of the stake of its participants. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary> What is staking?</summary>
Staking is the process of "locking" your tokens to receive rewards.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is the purpose of staking?  </summary>
The purpose of staking is network security. The tokens that are locked, the better for the system. This is done to prevent the so-called 51% attack. Which means that someone gains access to 51% of the resources and can then cheat the system in his favour. The rewards are the incentive which users receive for "locking" their tokens to protect the system.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Who or what are validators? </summary>
The validators are someone or rather a computer. Well, the word validator refers to both. Someone who runs a specific computer and the computer itself. Validators are making sure that all the transactions (communications) carried out in cyber are done correctly (i.e. that users aren't trying to cheat the system). Validators are auditable computers and their work is transparent. They have to reach consensus on the state of the ledger. And in cyber they compute (calculate) the knowledge graph that the users commit links to (they also commit links to the graph). For their work, they receive a reward from the blockchain. Which is automatically calculated by the system. Validators also participate in governance and can stake tokens to receive rewards. They can also stake delegators tokens and pay rewards out. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What or who is a delegator? </summary>
Delegators are uses that delegate their tokens to validators to participate in receiving staking rewards. For this validators might charge commission. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are smart contracts? </summary>
Smart contracts are programs that can program your protocol to behave in a certain way. For example, tell it to pay 10 coins to user A after he accomplishes a certain task. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a VM? </summary>
A virtual machine in computing is a computer system that allows one system to behave like another. In other words, it is a system inside another type of system. A real-world analogy would be the film "aliens". The alien is a VM in this case. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are knowledge graphs? </summary>
Knowledge graphs are a compilation of facts and information that provide meaning to a specific search result. I.E. if you search for Bitcoin, you might see a box on the side of the search results with lots of data about Bitcoin, what it is, where to get some, etc. This is essentially, the work of a knowledge graph. Currently, knowledge graphs use data from Wikipedia, Wikidata and other sources (which almost all, belong to google). 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's PageRank? </summary>
It is one of the algorithms used by google to rank search results. At a very basic level, it is based on the principle of counting incoming, quality links. Based on this information it decides what website should be ranked higher.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is web3? </summary>
Web3 is the next evolutionary step in the development of the web. A step that takes away from centralisation of search and social services and away from things that are depended on a single functioning unit (have a central source of authority). It is a step that desires to see involved counterparties and applications communicate directly one with another. In agreement with each other, whilst also, be motivated for this behaviour. And as a result, achieve a safer routing of data and packets (information exchange) on the web.<br>
Often, you might notice the term `Great Web` in our documents. For us, The Great Web is a much better-suited name for the more common term `web3`.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is IPFS?  </summary>
IPFS is a peer-to-peer (directly connected between two users) protocol, that is designed to make the web faster, safer, and more open. IPFS makes it possible to spread across high volumes of data and keeps every version of your files. IPFS makes it simple to set up networks for mirroring data. This means that data is pretty much immutable or if you may - everlasting.<br> 
IPFS helps to further distribute the web amongst peers (users). It enables constant availability — with or without internet connectivity. You can share and view files, manage large chunks of data, build applications, etc. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's governance? </summary>
Governance is the process via which the users of the ecosystem decide on what's going to be funded, how it is going to happen, etc. They do so via a voting mechanism.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a DAO? </summary>
A DAO is a decentralised autonomous organisation. It is a unity of users that mutually decided on the governance of something. This can be a protocol, a fund, an organisation, etc. A DAO does not have a physical representation. It is represented with the help of cryptography and code. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's Aragon? </summary>
Aragon is an application for creating decentralized, autonomous organisations backed by code rather than by centralised law. The distributed code becomes the law, where participating users have a say and an incentive for participating in the application/protocol. One may create global, bureaucracy-free organizations, companies, and communities with the help of Aragon. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are prediction markets? </summary>
Prediction markets are an example of communicating and financial incentives between actors (users) of an open market. A user can say "It is raining now" and back this information with data from a local weather station. Others may agree or disagree with this statement based on evidence provided by the initial predictor. He may put at stake his reputation or money. What this provides us with, is a system where rather than trusting a centralised source for providing certain information, we have a large number of independent sources, providing their opinion on a certain event with evidence. Hence, creating a provable and auditable service for some type of data (usually backed with a financial record). 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's an entity?  </summary>
An entity is an existing thing. An entity exists and that's all it needs to do to be an entity.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's a foundation? </summary>
When talking about construction a foundation is the lowest load-bearing part of a structure or building. When referring to organisations, a foundation is an entity that is managing the governing questions regarding its actions/structure, etc
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's a congress? </summary>
Congress can be a group of people picked by others to make challenging decisions. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a hardware wallet in terms of crypto?  </summary>
There are numerous ways to store your cryptocurrency (tokens). There are hot wallets. A hot wallet is one with access to the internet. There are two categories. One is when you own your private key (the good way) and in the other - is when you don't own your private key. For example, if you keep your tokens on an exchange (that's a bad way - do not do this!). You should always remember one simple rule: `Not your keys - not your crypto!`<br> 
There are cold wallets. Which are pretty safe if are created following a normal set of guidelines (plenty of guides around the internet). A cold wallet is one that does not have access to the internet. This can be a paper wallet or a physical wallet (either a metal device or a hardware wallet that never had access to the net).<br> 
Finally, there are hardware wallets (they can also be hot or cold). A hardware wallet is a small digital device which requires physical access to make a transaction. Usually, they come in the form of a slightly bigger than your typical USB stick which you can connect to your PC and you need to press buttons physically on the device to do anything.  Of course, this drastically increases security, even if the device is considered hot.

### Introduction
**Q:** What is cyber? <br>
**A:** Cyber is a decentralized google, for provable and relevant answers.

**Q:** What is the main mission of cyber? <br>
**A:** Its mission is to create a universal search protocol to (a) build an open semantic field of the internet with the help of blockchain technology and cyberlinks, and (b) decentralize the infrastructure of the web with the help of blockchain

**Q:** What cyber is NOT? <br>
**A:** Cyber is NOT a commercial product. It is not a product as such. It is an instrument if you wish or a tool, that anyone can use. That said, cyber allows for several ways for its participants to earn rewards.
Cyber is NOT the new internet. It is a tool that can help to shape and to decentralize (distribute the power of authority) the new Great Web and the services it has to offer.

**Q:** How does cyber work? <br>
**A:** Cyber is, essentially, creating a brand new protocol (a procedure that helps computers to do things in a certain way) for adding and searching information onto a knowledge graph (a compilation of facts about something that provides meaning to the user). And rank this information. In other words, it's a decentralized google.

Users create links between 2 IPFS hashes (*hint: essentially, an IPFS hash is just a representation of some data*) and place them on a knowledge graph by spending bandwidth (amount of data that can be transmitted over a fixed period of time). Users also link IPFS hashes linked to keywords, which helps to enrich the knowledge graph with... *knowledge*.

That content is then dynamically ranked with the help of digital tokens and the current parameters of the networks load. This makes the rank dynamic (characterized by continuous change, activity, or progress).

All this is computed (determined with the help of a computer) by validators (a program or a computer that are responsible for checking the validity of something). The validators do so, by using their GPU's (literally - graphics cards).

This allows to search data on the web, rank it, query it (look it up) and create knowledge databases without blackbox intermediaries (third parties that try to censor data, hide or push specific results to obtain money, track your data, etc).

The interesting thing is that such a simple mechanism allows creating a lot of powerful tools as a result. We will go in-detail further down the document into those. For example: unified semantics, SEO instruments, autonomous robots, and a lot more.

**Q:** What is a relevance machine? <br>
**A:** Quite often throughout our explanations we refer to cyber as `A Relevance Machine`. The simple explanation lies in the meaning of the words themselves. cyber acts as a verifiable and provable intermediary for relevance between any two objects at any point and time. In other words, cyber can prove that A was relevant to B at a certain place, at a certain time and under specific conditions. 

When a user creates a cyberlink, he expresses the will to do so by backing this cyberlink with some weight in CYB tokens. In other words, the user submits to the knowledge graph what is important for him. The meaning extraction for knowledge in the case of cyber is incentivized. The submitted cyberlinks are dynamically ranked and project relevance to those who submitted them. 

Cyber uses Merkle trees to build proofs for the submitted links, creating a provable and auditable chain of information down to the root. The more agents inquire the knowledge graph, the more valuable the knowledge becomes. Based on this, the relevance between cyberlinks can be computed. Via querying and delivering answers in such fashion, a simple mechanism is constructed - the relevance machine. 

**Q:** Why cyber? <br> 
**A:** We like that name. That's one reason. We have been using this name throughout our projects for the past 6 - 7 years.

Actually, cyber refers to anything that is very smart. The meaning is rooted in the word cybernetics (check out this article on Wikipedia) - a science which describes the behaviour of dynamic systems with feedback loops.

In popular culture, it has become a partial synonym to all the crazy sci-fi things out there. Like the cyber-track by Elon Musk and co. Cyber refers to cyberspace. Space free from centralized, human influence and bureaucracy. It is the Andromeda of freedom. The last frontier...

### The history of cyber
The idea of cyber was incepted in late 2016. The original white paper was written by [@xhipster](https://github.com/xhipster) while still working with cyber·Fund. In 2017 a team of engineers began working on developing the project, that was then called cyber·Search. 

The idea behind cyber·Search was to create a blockchain agnostic explorer, that would enable anyone to search for any metadata within any blockchain. We have a small [retro landing page](https://cybercongress.github.io/cyber-search/) left from those days. 

After some time the team behind cyber·Search left and cyber~Congress was born. If you are curious, [watch those videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpI87MxJymc) to see how it happened (*hint: you can also watch some of the original cyber.seach videos on the same youtube channel*). 

The team was dedicating time to research and building. As time progressed, so did cyber·Search. The team grew, the idea grew and eventually, the results of good research, skilled engineering and the development of blockchain technology, led to the transformation of cyber·Search - into cyber, along with the birth of cyber~Rank, the mechanism that ranks information in cyber.  

The idea grew bigger and bigger until at one point it became what it is today. cyber wasn't an explorer anymore, it was now a global and innovative search mechanism for the new web.

The current white paper took 3 years of work to complete. The team that stands behind cyber changed pretty much altogether, but the original idea of making a universal and an intelligent search still stands (*hint: you can see the current team [here](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/teams/cybercongress.toml)*). 

The idea of cyber is still developing. But today it's not raw anymore. Today cyber has a clear vision of abolishing the chains of digital slavery through decentralizing the semantics of the web and its services.  

### The philosophy behind cyber
To understand cyber one first needs to understand its philosophy. Our work isn't simply technical. We base our work on our values. If it wasn't for them, we were not be building cyber. To be completely open about our intentions, I will jump into the story of the team behind cyber, and how values are our core driver. The core team knows each other for several years and has worked together previously. At one point, a few years ago we separated our ways, only to realize that whatever we do, we do not share values of others, hence, bringing the team back together.

What do we believe in? Firstly we believe in freedom, privacy and decentralization. We share and propagate the vision of improving this world. We believe that evil stands behind a centralized, bureaucratic approach to technology, governance, communication protocols (money), etc.

We do believe in code. We believe in innovation and in making use of our knowledge to make the world a slightly better place for our children. With that in mind, what we are trying to say, is that cyber and cyb are not just technological results. They are much more. At its base lay the values of the team behind cyber. We hope that our project can re-create certain values of what we believe the blockchain paradigm stands for. 

*Q&A on the philosophy behind cyber:*

<details>
  <summary>What problem are you trying to solve? </summary>
We are trying to solve the problem of data centralization and data censorship. Which in other words, is the decentralization of common knowledge (assuming that data is the new knowledge and that we are moving into the digital age).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why are you doing this?  </summary>
Each person should be able to control their own data, their identity, their knowledge. The universe can become a better place if our children live in a digital environment where they are in charge of their actions.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's wrong with google?  </summary>
google is a brilliant idea. We do not deny this. But google is the rebel that has overthrown the dictator and became the dictator itself. google uses you to shape the essence and the fundamentals of communications between everyone and everything. Whilst at it, google doesn't care for anyone and will make money on your action and your behalf.<br>
It should be noted, that by this question I am attempting not just at google, but at all the mega-digital corporations. Feel free to check out what this can lead to in the shape of [Cambridge Analityca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica). If this case is too much to take in or too "loud" for you, feel free to watch some episodes of Black Mirror to see how digital control can "break" society.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why now? </summary>
Because we are almost done with post-industrialism. We are slowly and surely moving into the digital realm. One can deny or accept this. Now is the time to either have the tools that will help us to shape the matrix the way we want to shape it or give those powers away to someone to control all aspects of our lives.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why search? </summary>
Search is a global mechanism that is globally understood by everyone, regardless of language, race, age, etc. It is somewhat a basic instinct (searching for food to survive, etc). In the digital realm with the help of search, we gain answers to our questions, which we always ask. Search helps us to build a model around any subject that is of interest to us. With the use of search, we can build databases, which can lead to a great number of useful instruments (on these later).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Aren't there other, more important problems to solve? </summary>
There probably are. But we decided to focus on this because we understand how to achieve the required result. There are probably more problems and questions to be solved (like hunger, wars, ecology, etc). Our tool can help to play a role in solving if not all, but some of these.  
  </details>
  
<details>
  <summary>Aren't there other things out there that solve this? </summary>
There is a lot of awesome, open-source technology on the market that can commit to making a change in the world. Most of the technology we use is not something we invented (although the code itself is written from scratch!). They are technologies that have existed previously and are awesome at doing what they do. Our software is a combination of existing technologies, protocols and our work that has arisen from this. It is specifically targeted at fixing what is broken.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How can users/developers/others benefit from using such a system in comparison to google, etc?  </summary>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/7hX2GbQC/cyber.png" />
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why do you need consensus within Cyber? </summary>
A consensus is required for nodes to agree on the current state of the ledger at any given point of time. This is needed to achieve security, transparency, immutability and decentralization. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is your take on: privacy/censorship/routing? </summary>
We believe that privacy should be a fundamental right. As of now, the protocol is pseudo-private (just like Bitcoin is). I.E. you know which hash linked something and with what weight, but you don't know the real name of the user. With that, we are planning to implement full privacy into the protocol.<br>
We are strongly discouraged by any censorship and view it as a sin against any living and/or thinking organism.<br> 
Routing should be always permitted. Transactions should always be permitted to pass. Otherwise, this is censorship.

  <summary>Do you not think that the motto #fuckgoogle is offensive? </summary>
Fuck no! Fucking is not for pain, it's for pleasure!

### The cyber~Congress DAO and its role
You already learned about the inception of cyber~ Congress. If you missed it, catch the videos of the birth of the original cyber~Congress [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUfxwbONrtEFeCHOA3gHT-g/videos).

cyber ~Congress was set up as a DAO. The initial intentions of cyber ~Congress can be found [in this document:`the evolution of species`](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/README.md). Today that manifest is still being worked on and is still in development. 

cyber~Congress helps to launch the protocol, commits to the code base, helps to gather the initial community, write the initial documentation, organise the distribution and deploy the Genesis. The Congress lives in Ethereum, as an Aragon DAO. It is responsible for organising the Game of links and the minting of THC tokens.

As of today, cyber~Congress is a 2/2 DAO for decision making and a 2/3 DAO in terms of security. However, it should be noted, that some decisions are already wider diversified as the whole team that works on the DAO takes part in most of the decision. In the future, we hope this will become automatized and the DAO will grow. 

There are 3 points on which we should touch when discussing cyber~Congress:
1) cyber~ Congress is the launching DAO behind cyber. For its work, a 14.3% share of the governing token, THC, is allocated to cyber~Congress. This share will be staked during cyber ~Auction to receive an equal amount in CYB tokens. This means that the congress will be a functioning entity in the life of the protocol. However, cyber is a community governed protocol. From the numbers above, one can tell, that the majority of the stake is going to be in the hands of the community. The protocol will be governed by the validators and the community via a governance mechanism, proposals and prediction markets.   

2) The manifest outlies the idea that all species should (and will) have an equal opportunity for secure and transparent communication. Intelligence can be simplified to communication. All species can communicate via electromagnetic impulses (including robots). If they can communicate (which they can), they can prove their existence and pass on a signal and receive an answer. This is intelligence at its most pure form. The main mission of cyber~Congress is `To help the evolution of species!`

3) cyber~Congress as a DAO plans on developing cyber, taking part in the governance, launching `cyber~FundClassic`, an ecosystem development fund, that will help cyber to evolve (*hint: further in the document, a whole section is dedicated to the description of the ecosystem*), form strategic partnerships and buidl applications. The DAO plans to stake the received ATOM tokens from the first donation round to its Cosmos [fuckgoogle validator](https://cosmos.bigdipper.live/validator/cosmosvaloper1e859xaue4k2jzqw20cv6l7p3tmc378pc3k8g2u), and support the incentives of the team via the received rewards. The DAO also plans to have a sustainable income flow, described in [this issue](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues/302).

------------------------------------------------------

## :computer: Section subtitle: Prepare for take-off
This section will get you acquainted with all the bits and bobs there are to cyber. This includes all of our projects, our community plans, the launch process and how to get some fuel to bootstrap yourself to save the galaxy, most importantly this section teaches you how to become a hero and validate cyber!

### Using cyber: The very basics
#### cyber~Page
We suggest you start your acquaintance with using cyber from [cyber.page](http://cyber.page/). It is a small taste (it is, currently, in alpha mode) of an IPFS based search application, that allows one to search for semantically enriched and dynamically ranked IPFS content, with the help of the cyber protocol.

First of all, one needs to watch the short, Episode 1 story at the beginning (giggles are on us), by clicking `Play story`:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/KzPkY6qv/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-14-45-15.png" />

Just turn on the speakers and enjoy the journey:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/85NWLkrr/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-14-47-34.png" />

You are now on the main page. Rest assured, it's working. Let me remind you that when google introduced their notorious sear bar, people were ready to kill. We think simple is good. Black is sexy:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/6q7QvFzv/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-14-49-02.png" />

Try clicking the search box in the middle and search for something original like `cyber`:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/yxzZ717N/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-14-51-12.png" />

This will return some results:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/k4wmgwmt/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-14-53-50.png" />

Those are sparks (snippets), containing cyberlinked hashes, that someone linked, enriched semantically and here they are. The numbers next to the hashes are the current ranks.

The sparks don’t look fantastically attractive. But they will be later. They will even be alive and P2P-style interactive in the future. Let’s click on one of the results (please be patient, the network is still slow and the first time around it might take a while until something loads - this is peer discovery. More so, there is a possibility something won’t even load, as it was unpinned):

(Of course, the results are dynamic, the first hash led me to the cyber WP. Let us know what results you got)

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/DwY5nXHy/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-14-56-16.png" />

Let’s click on the brain. That purple essence in the top left corner:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/YqQhpKP4/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-14-58-58.png" />

This will take us onto the main knowledge page:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/GtcSH1Qc/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-15-00-01.png" />

Here, you may explorer network statistics, validators, economic parameters, % of staked tokens, bandwidth price, etc. To do this, simply click on any of the buttons. I.E. `Cybernomics`, `Bandwidth`, etc

Notice that the top box, at the top, becomes searchable. You can perform search actions from here too. More so, cyber doesn't just understand keywords, it also understands addresses. For example, try searching an ETH address:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/y8Pt9jx1/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-15-08-22.png" />

This will, most likely, take you to the gift page:

(Cyber gifted 10% of its supply to [ETH](https://www.ethereum.org/), [ATOM](https://cosmos.network/) and [URBIT](https://urbit.org/) hodlers)

If the address was lucky and got gifted, you will see something like this:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/8z1n1vHq/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-15-08-56.png" />

(Otherwise, the results will display gift:0)

Now, try clicking the robot in the top right corner: 

(Notice, that when you hover over it, it displays text with links, feel free to explore them)

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/4x9nxKxQ/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-15-10-44.png" />

This takes you to the Ledger page:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/0rgRWN19/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-15-12-14.png" />

If you click the bottom button `Put Ledge into the pocket`, it will offer you to connect your Ledger (on this, later on, with different guides):

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/jd8kS5F2/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-15-14-03.png" />

Notice that the network is still learning, so if you type in something cyber isn't aware of yet, you will be displayed with this:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/gk93qPLs/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-15-15-24.png" />

However, you will see a result. This is a hash that takes you to an explanation page if you click it:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Qdf2WmYQ/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-15-17-12.png" />

Let's go back to the brain by clicking it:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/YqQhpKP4/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-14-58-58.png" />

Notice, how there is a message box, right under the top search box, saying you need tokens. Click on the `Game of Links` green link. This will take you here:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/25cLJsc1/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-15-19-38.png" />

Here, you may find details about the Game of Links, its distribution. Check out the `Masters path` (builder of the Great Web) or the `Heros path` (validators of the Great Web) by clicking on either. The results will help you to understand more details.

For now, we will finish the initial sign guide for [cyber.page](http://cyber.page/). When you use this guide, you might discover that since its inception, new features have been added. Even now, some pages like the [governance page](https://cyber.page/governance), are already being tested.

### IPFS / Cosmos & Tendermint
A lot of the time, cyber is asked: why Cosmos? Or why IPFS? <br>
Here are the answers:

 <details>
  <summary>How do you use IPFS? </summary>
   cyber uses IPFS as the current backbone on which users perform the search. Think about IPFS for cyber, as of the fridge, and cyber is the lightbulb inside of it. Users use IPFS to store and publish content and files. cyber lets users rank, index and find it. If there was no lightbulb, how would you find food in the fridge during those hungry nights?
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>Why is IPFS better than other protocols? </summary>
  cyber does not claim that something is better than something else. However, IPFS is revolutionary. It is the first protocol that created content-based addressing, which allowed cyber to build cyberlinks on top of it and change the way we search for information. 
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>What other protocols are you planning to use? </summary>
 cyber plans to be protocol agnostic. For both stateless protocols (in which no session information is retained by the receiver): IPFS, Swarm, DAT, Git, BitTorrent, or stateful, such as: Bitcoin, Ethereum, other blockchains and tangles. This means the cyber is smart enough to understand any type of protocol is taught and can truly become the backbone of search for the Great Web. 
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>Why do use Cosmos/Tendermint? </summary>
  (1) When we started to build Cosmos was already in mainnet. (2) Cosmos has IBC, a protocol that allows for data transfer between sovereign blockchains. (3) We share the decentralized, non-monolithic philosophy that Cosmos preaches. (4) The security of Tendermint and Cosmos-SDK is top-notch 
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>How do you use Cosmos? </summary>
  Cosmos provides the consensus mechanism for cyber. We use Tendermint as an engine that helps the network to reach agreement on its current state, perform transactions on the blockchain, validate search results, etc
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>Why don't you use Polkadot or other solutions? </summary>
  For now, others do not exist. Polkadot was still tested when we started. Also, we tend to agree more with the philosophy of Cosmos and we hope to be connected to Polka via bridges and relayers when they finally arise.
  </details>

### cyber~Metagalaxy
cyber is a galaxy of smaller components. Why? The simple answer, is why not? The other answer is that we want to divide the work evenly and equally amongst several entities that are each responsible for their field of work. Most importantly, this work has to be done efficiently, and breaking it up into smaller parts - helps a lot. A browser is an application, while the protocol is the protocol. They are not one entity. Same goes for the governing process. Different entities are responsible for different questions.

**A visualization of the metagalaxy:**

To be continued...

**Selected questions about the componnets that make up the galaxy:**  
  <details>
  <summary>What is cyber? </summary>

  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>What is Cyb? </summary>
Cyb is your friendly robot/personal browser application. One one hand it is a mere browser. But it isn't. The problem is that there is no such word as of now that describes what cyb is exactly. It is a browser in the sense that it lets you search for things. But it is your personal applications, that can understand many other things. It can act as a wallet. It can act as a database. It contains your cyber-space robots. For now, we call this a browser. But I would imagine that something along - a personal customizable web application, provides a better description.
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>What is cyber~Page? </summary>
cyber~Page is the gateway of the protocol. It allows you to search for things. Obtain results. View statistics. Use governance procedures. It is part of Cyb.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>What is dot~Cyber? </summary>
dot~Cyber is another name for cyber.page: a reference interface for the cyber protocol.
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>What is cyber~Congress? </summary>
The congress is the DAO behind the launch of the protocol. The initial intentions of cyber~Congress can be found in the Evolution of Species. The congress helps to launch the protocol, commits to the code base, helps to gather the initial community, write the initial documentation, organise the distribution and deploy the Genesis. The Congress lives in Ethereum, as an Aragon DAO. It is responsible for organising the Game of links and the minting of THC tokens. The congress will launch the protocol, hand it over to the community and remain a functioning entity that commits to the code, improves the protocol and makes it an intergalactic product.
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>What are the distribution games? </summary>
This is described in a separate section in detail. In short, those are the technical games that help cyber~Congress and cyber to achieve a better distribution for the protocol and the governance tokens.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>What is the vesting app? </summary>
The vesting application is an app used to vest your tokens during cyber~Auction and claim a 1-1 equivalent amount of tokens in the cyber blockchain after the end of the auction. 
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>What is governance in cyber? </summary>
The cyber protocol is governed by its users. We will talk about specifics further. But, the idea is that it is the users that should decide, by coming to a majority agreement, on what is and should be happening in terms of development, what rewards they should receive, how should a certain something work and so on.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>What is cyber~Foundation? </summary>
It is a community governed DAO. The role of cyber~Foundation is to help the community govern the protocol via an Aragon DAO. It is a fund managed via a decentralized engine, charged with the donated ETH and managed by the community (agents of the protocol).
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>What is cyber~Ecosystem? </summary>
It is the entity that is responsible for helping to grow the ecosystem. Its common goal: to build a better and a unique new web: the Great Web. To achieve this it will help to form partnerships, onboard communities, help research, connect people, do VC work when necessary, create and review documentation, participate in the governance, help to validate and build the chain and its applications.
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>Who are cyber~FundClassic? </summary>
It is the future fund to be created and to help applications grow within the cyber ecosystem, with the help of cyber~Congress and cyber~Foundation. 
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>What is cyb~Virus? </summary>
The virus is a chrome extension (in the future this may apply to other web2 browsers). Its idea is to demonstrate the ability of cyber to download, save and rank any content from web2 to web3. We use chrome because we like irony. The idea to fuck google right in google's playground fascinates us.
  </details>

   <details>
  <summary>What is the brain? </summary>
The brain is the explorer of cyber. It shows transactions and statistics.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>What is gravity? </summary>
Gravity is a librabry that contains the visual components of cyb.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>Whats Chaingear? </summary>
Chaingear is one of our secret weapons. It is not yet fully described by us. But in its essence, it is an ETH based ability for anyone to create a personal or a public database with the help of NFT tokens. For example, one may create the database .porn and then create records in that database. I.E. world.porn, and yes, it works just like a domain-based structure. But it's not a domain-based structure, as it allows you to create other types of databases too.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>What are crawlers? </summary>
Crawlers will become tools that help masters and builders of the Great Web to migrate knowledge from web 2 to the new metaverse.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>Who is cyber~Admin </summary>
cyber~Admin is an intelligent bot that helps the cyber~Cogress team to work. In fact, he is a full member of the team.
  </details>

### cyber~Ecosystem
The cyber~Ecosystem is a subdivision of the metagalaxy. The ecosystem division is working towards a common goal: to build a better and a unique new web: `The Great Web`.

The coordination of efforts include:
- helping to create a validator pool
- helping to build communities
- connecting teams
- helping R&D
- cross-promote products and protocols
- provide strategic grants in the future
- creating and taking part in governance proposals
- VC and partnerships
- creating useful and unique documentation
- working towards a common goal

To get familiar with the cyber~Cosystem, we strongly suggest you read the [ecoystem development paper](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md), which includes a view on the development of cyber ~Ecosystem, describe what it is, its goals, values and participants. It should also offer theoretical and practical metrics that can measure the success of the proposed building blocks that will form the growth of the ecosystem. 

Full information about the ecosystem can be found in [the transparency folder](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/tree/master/ecosystem) of the congress repository.

#### Community
The work of the ecosystem is made out of various blocks, including:
- [Community work](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md#community-work): One of the main goals is to form a community of scientists, geeks, researches, validators, hackers, web3 agents and users as such (of any other possible category) for Cyber. The goal is to target all of [the relevant communites](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues/289), by which we mean a spectre of modern and efficient computers and their communities, rather than the foundations or organizations standing behind those projects
- [Cyberc-n](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md#cyberc0n): cyber~Congress has already organised one [self-governing event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfG_mn6psRQ&list=PL-MRS5fkWajCmfAS1WxBVgtMdFPmS4WTZ). Its goal is to achieve a completely sovereign and a self-ruling entity, that humans can help to run
- [Friendly aliens and partenrships](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md#friendly-aliens-and-partenrships):  We need to form strategic partnerships. We believe that developing Cyber means developing computing, rather than developing foundations behind those computers. This means that we will, first of all, look for similar values with our future allies
- [Governance and proposals](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md#governance-and-proposals): This means community governance for pretty much everything. Building applications, developing the protocol, onboarding projects, etc
- [Hacking and open-source](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md#hacking-and-open-source): If there is one thing that we believe in more than all else, it is probably open-source. Hence, we understand the value of building a community of open-source contributors
- [Research and R&D](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md#research-and-rd): We want to prove that our vision of the [Evolution of spicies](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/README.md) can and will uphold. All this requires research. A lot of research. Open-source, funded research that will benefit, not just Cyber, but will benefit the world.
- [VC](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md#vc): All this requires funds. As much as we would love for all to simply help us, distribute our tokens and let the beast live - we are aware that we are leaving in a world spun by money, which in itself isn't bad. Money is simply a communication protocol, alas - one that is broken
- [cyber~FundClassic](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md#cyberfundclassic): This fund will be funded out of the personal bag of cyber~Congress and its team members that wish to fund it. However, we believe that a further option of having community members also help to fund should remain open. The idea of the fund is to help buidl applications on top of the protocol
-[The important generation](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md#the-important-generation): We have stated on many occasions that we must concentrate on younger generations, not simply because they are the users and the engineers of tomorrow. That is, of course - one reason. But the reality is that the young (and the coming) generation has a completely different recognition of what we do. And that is a good thing

#### Communication flow & Blog
We believe that communication is uber important, hence we define a [communciation proccess](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/teams/communication%20and%20publishing.md) in which we describe the importance of communicating via [cyber~Blog](https://cybercongress.ai/post/) to the [relevant communities](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues/289).

cyber~Congress strongly values the importance of reports, we describe our flow of reporting in [this document](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/teams/team%20reports.md).

We also communicate via other arteries described below:

#### Congress website & cyber.page
The main gateway to cyber is, of course, [cyber.page](https://cyber.page/), an interface reference to the whole protocol. This is our main landing and targeting page. A road to Rome. Here you will find everything you need to know in order to use cyber. 

We also have a [website](http://cybercongress.ai/) for the DAO behind the launch of cyber: cyber~Congress. On this website you can find information about our projects, some basic statistics and, most importantly [technical docuamnetation](https://cybercongress.ai/docs/cyberd/cyberd/) for cyber and cyb, the [forum](http://ai.cybercongress.ai/) and the [blog](https://cybercongress.ai/post). Via this website and our [GitHub](https://github.com/cybercongress) cyber ~Congress communicates with the outer world. 

#### GitHub
Of course, everything we do is 100% open-source. Hence GitHub. Our [GitHub](https://github.com/cybercongress) contains many useful repositories filled with love, code and documentation, including the document you are reading right now. 

If you are looking for releases, code sources, want to help us via an issue or a pull request, this is the place to be. Also, this is the quickest place to get an answer to any question you have to the cyber~Congress team.

#### Gitcoin
We believe in progress. We value contribution. We believe that we need to learn to help one another. This is why we want to develop the [Gitcoin program](https://gitcoin.co/profile/cybercongress) inside of cyber. Every sprint we try to allocate a certain amount of ETH and distribute it between our team members to actively use gitcoin.

<a href="https://gitcoin.co/explorer?q=cyberd">
 <img src="https://gitcoin.co/funding/embed?repo=https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberd">
</a>

#### Cyberc-n
Off-line events allow communities to grow stronger. Hackathons and useful conferences can help to build-up new teams together, allow form fabulous new creations. A perfect example of how awesome events shape the world was DEVCON-0, but we believe we can do much better.

cyber~Congress ha already organised one [self-governing event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfG_mn6psRQ&list=PL-MRS5fkWajCmfAS1WxBVgtMdFPmS4WTZ). To our knowledge, it was the first world conference to be run by a smart contract. We think that this is how it should be. And just as others, we learn our lessons.

In our plans for the coming year, to organise Cyberc1n. It will be a completely sovereign and a self-ruling entity, that humans can help to run. No more boring and long speeches. We plan entirely new formats, with whiteboards, geeks and ~blakc-jack~ coding.

#### Evangelists
The idea of an evangelist is to preach about cyber. To bootstrap this we created the Open Bootstrap Evangelism Program (OBEP), which after the bootstrap will, hopefully, carry on thanks to governance commitments and the community pool.

_Mission:_ Increase initial traction. Build strong local and/or online community
_Tooling:_ cyber tools that help. Creativity
_General Tasks:_ Translations. Creations of chats. Groups. Meetups. DR (donation relations). Governance. Hackathons. Etc

For this cyber~Congress has allocated a community pool and set out guidelines, during the bootstrap. Details can [be found here](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues/307). For us this is a long term relationship, so, we will create a distributed Evangelist network, that will be funded in CYB tokens from the ecosystem ~Fund via governance. 

#### Meetups & Hackathons
One of the main goals for cyber~Congress and the evangelist team will be to create useful and meaningful meetups, where people will onboard to cyber. This can be enhanced by Hackathons and other offline initiatives from the community.

#### Partnering communities
There are many importnat communities that cyber sees as vital for the success of building `the Great Web`, those communities include:

(The idea behind publishing these as a check-list, is that you may copy this task-list or print it out and help cyber to get more traction within these communitites. Feel free to include any [mentions here](https://ai.cybercongress.ai/t/mentions-of-the-beast-in-the-wild/40/51))

### Launch process
As of writing this document, cyber is still in public testing. The current public, incentivized testnet is `euler-5`, it is also the chain-id.

The launch of cyber considers many different aspects, and we believe that to grasp cyber fully, one must also be familiar with the launch process. This is also a move to cement the launch process as a transparent event.

In this section, we will concentrate on the period of post-euler-5 and up to the end of cyber~Auction, which ends 500 days after the launch of the mainnet. However, the full process is described below.

#### Full launch roadmap
- 2016: First WP draft, research, self-funding (this part applies throughout the current lifetime of the protocol)
- 2017: Evolution of cyber~Search into cyber, development work
- 2018: Protocol development, first implementations
- 2018.11.10 - 2019.03.05: Launch of the `Winter round for friends` public [donations](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/26a33ce5ed92204f67c79dd8036690019bcf3f89/friends/winter.md), protocol development, public testing
- 2019: Protocol development, public testing
- 2019.01.31: Release of [euler-1](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberd/releases/tag/v0.1.1)
- 2019.06.28: The release of [Barcelona](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb/releases/tag/0.1.4), cybs demo for the IPFS community
- 2019.12.02: Release of the final [White Paper](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmceNpj6HfS81PcCaQXrFMQf7LR5FTLkdG9sbSRNy3UXoZ)
- 2019.12.20: [Launch of Game of Links and euler-5](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/pull/316/files#diff-41de23aee25953091ba5a3c0ae012855)
- Here and thereafter the dates are subject to change due to dynamic properties and development work
- 2020, end of winter - the beginning of spring: Launch of governance and vesting apps/modules
- 2020, spring: Launch of public donation round
- 2020, 90 days or 600k ATOM after the previous event: End of Game of Links
- 2020, (presumably) summer: Launch of the mainnet and Game of thrones
- 2020, and for a period of 21 days after the launch of the mainnet: Game of Thrones
- 2020 - 2021, after Game of Thrones: cyber~Auction, which lasts for 479 days

#### Distribution games introduction
The distribution games are a way of improving the distribution of tokens to a higher number of participants in a fairer way through a gamified process. There are 3 distribution games proposed in total. Their goal is to help increase the initial efficiency of the distribution.

**Q:** What is Game of Links (GoL)?<br>
**A:** The name is partially self-explanatory here. The idea is to distribute tokens based on several parameters (disciplines within the game). Those include not just linking but some other technical things. The simple idea behind this is to make the protocol better at the start and to make sure tokens are distributed to those who are interested most in the success of the idea (initial believers).

**Q:** What is Game of Thrones (GoT)? <br>
**A:** It's a game where one community of hodlers tries to outbid the other in return for receiving a larger discount. 10% of CYB supply is allocated per each competing community. 100 TCYB to the ATOM community for donating ATOM. And an equivalent amount to the ETH community, which will initially receive THC tokens that they can lock during the auction in exchange for CYB tokens (in other words the ETH donators can potentially receive both THC and CYB tokens). The game will last for 21 days.

**Q:** What is cyber~Auction?<br>
**A:** cyber ~Auction is part of the initial distribution games. If the first two focus on specific target groups (although anyone is free to participate). The goal of cyber ~Auction is to focus on all types of users. It will take place after the end of the previous games.

The auction will last for 500 rounds that last for 23 hours each (a little over 479 days). Every round has 1 billion THC is at skate. The more you donate and the less has been donated by others on that same day the more you can gain. After the end of the distribution, participants will be able to unlock their THC tokens and use them as they wish, e.i. transfer, trade, etc. As a result of the auction, the community will have access to all the donated ETH within the Aragon organization.

One more mega important part of the auction to remember, are the creative powers of THC. If you vest your THC tokens for the period of the auction - you receive 1 CYB token for each locked THC token for the duration of the auction!

*(Hint: A thorough guide on the games is in the beep, beep, beep section) 

#### The launch protocol and initial GoL details
For the slightly technically advanced users, there is a [laucnh-kit repository](https://github.com/cybercongress/launch-kit) that can take you through each part of the Genesis launch protocol. Here, we will concentrate on the main parts of it.

Here is the full visualization of the launch protocol:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/mDcz3JRV/launch-protocol-v2.png" />

And, here you can see the details of the launch process from euler-5, to the end of Game of Thrones:

#### Lucnh FAQ

  <details>
  <summary>Why the procedure is so complex? </summary>
 It isn't. It might seem like this to the naked eye. The reasons behind it are the desire to separate each detail of the protocol and work on it thoroughly, to use all of the experience that our team has and not to repeat the mistakes of other projects.
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>Can you describe the launch process in a paragraph? </summary>
From 2016-2019 we were working on researching, developing and publicly testing the protocol. At the end of 2019, we launched the first leg of the distribution games, made to increase initial traction, test the protocol and achieve good distribution. The first part is the game of links, which is an incentivized game with different technical disciplines and a public donation round in ATOMs to the cyber~Congress DAO. The second parts are made out of Game of Thornes, the game between ETH and ATOM communities to outbid each other and get more tokens from cyber~Congress, and cyber ~Auction, the 479-day long auction, in equal windows with public ETH donations to the community DAO governing the protocol. GoT is window 0 of the auction. The auction takes part after the launch of the mainnet.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>How to get involved at this stage? </summary>
Play the Game of Links. launch a validator. Submit links to the knowledge graph. Helps us to get traction. Become an evangelist. Help us to test the governance, etc.
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>Do you have a White Paper? </summary>
Yes, it can be found via this IPFS link: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmceNpj6HfS81PcCaQXrFMQf7LR5FTLkdG9sbSRNy3UXoZ
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>When are you launching a stable mainnet? </summary>
The network will launch when Game of Links is done (the other 2 games are held after the launch). There are 146 active validators and all the tokens are distributed. As of the end of 2019, the ETA is summer 2020. We strongly encourage participation when GoL kicks-off!
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>Who are the people behind the project? </summary>
We are a team of geeks, enthusiasts, thinkers, hackers and people who firmly believe in what they want to achieve. If you wish to, you can skim through our GitHub and easily find links to some of our public profiles (like keybase) and much more information about each one of us. All of us can be reached here or on our forums.
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>How do I contact you? </summary>
Via our GitHub, via our forum or our TG chat. All links are at the end of this document. 
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary> So, How do I use it?</summary>
Please see the Using cyber: the very basics section for this.
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>What is the fastest way to get tokens? </summary>
Play the Game of course! Another quick way is to use future faucets or Kira's TG bot, which you can find on our TG channel.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>How many tokens do I need to start using cyber? </summary>
There isn't a specific amount of tokens you need to use the network. This is a very dynamic property. The current statistics can be viewed on cyber.page. It should be noted that all transactions require bandwidth (resources). However, transactions don't spend your tokens. The tokens "freeze" for some time, after which, they are released back to the user. This is a spam protection mechanism.
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>Can I contribute? </summary>
Other than in the ways described in the section about how to get involved, you may also try to solve issues, submit PRs or help us with research. 
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>Will I be rewarded for my contributions? </summary>
There are several ways someone can get rewarded:
We actively use GitCoin. This means that we fund some of our tasks and issues. If you are an open-source developer, you can solve issues and get rewarded.
We constantly announce grants for open-source development and research. For example our Urbit open-source proposal
You can gain social weight and social reputation by becoming an early adopter (please make conclusions for yourself, as to what this might gain).
If you run a validator node, you are entitled to receive rewards that are described above.
You can take advantage of the community pool.
You can be a part of the OBEP. 
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>Is this an ICO? </summary>
The projects receive donations from users who wish to donate them and participate in the distribution games. The process can be referred to as an initial community offering. Which is the process where the community understands the value of the proposed idea and decides to donate towards its development for its own benefit.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>Why do you need donations? </summary>
Thanks to ATOM donations we want to secure a commitment for cyber~Congress in the development of both: Cosmos and Cyber ecosystems. ATOM donations will allow for cyber ~Congress to use staking rewards for continuous funding of the protocol without the necessity to dump tokens.
THC donations will be managed by an Aragon DAO (the community) to help develop the protocol in the longterm.
