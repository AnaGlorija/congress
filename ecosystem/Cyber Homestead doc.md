## :fuelpump: Section subtitle: Ground floor
Cosmonauts do not become who they are if the initial training hasn't been done properly. In this section, you will find out about some basic terminology that you will need to understand cyber, and dive right into some of its basics. Including the history of cyber, how it works, how to use it and our philosophy.

### Technical questions in plain terms
*Click on the below questions to expand the answer:*
<details>
  <summary> What are distributed technologies? </summary>
Distributed technologies are technologies that do not have a central source of power in terms of computing and storage. In terms of blockchains (distributed data ledgers), it is primarily referred to databases that are shared across multiple independent sources and have an agreement on the shared information at any point in time in those databases (are in consensus).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a consensus computer?</summary>
A consensus in computing refers to the process of different computers agreeing on some data and/or its value. For example, they might need to agree on the current time or whether or not Alice has 10 BTC (Bitcoins) on her account balance. So, a consensus computer is a computer that is involved in that process (usually used specifically and solely for that purpose).
  </details>
  
<details>
  <summary> What's a hash? </summary>
A hash means a reworking of old and familiar material. In computing, this refers to a bunch of symbols that represent a particular piece of information/data/file (more precisely, it authenticates the fact that the data represented is what it is). In other words, it is a `fingerprint`. 
I.E a sha256 hash of `cyber` is: `99100ac04db2147ef246377b1ea4fc0c17106d37286e5d61cc02201301a85bbb`. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary> What is a Merkle tree?</summary>
A Merkle tree is the name of a representation (an analogy if you may) of how some data (information) is structured (into a database). It is shaped like a tree, where there is one major root, from which others spawn and they are related to it. From those more branches/roots spawn out, until we get to the leaves, which represent the current upper level of the information. All the information can be traced from any point to any other point and is mathematically tied one to another.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a blockchain? </summary>
A blockchain is a distributed ledger into which independent participants write, and read from it - information. It is protected by the fact that it is distributed across participants computers, which are in agreement one with another at any point of a given time (past or present). A blockchain is auditable to anyone and transparent. This allows its participants to make sure that there is nothing shady happening in the background. Usually, data in blockchains is structured with the help of a Merkle tree or a Directed Acyclic Graph (more commonly knows as a DAG, which in very basic terms, is just a different way of structuring data). 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a transaction? </summary>
In terms of a blockchain, a transaction is a process of moving data. I.E. I have 10 dollars and pass them to your account. I made a transaction.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's a token? </summary>
A token in blockchain terms is a digital representation of some certain value, relating to a specific distributed ledger. It should contain some utility i.e. it should be used to do something, which in turn gives it value for the participants (users) of that ledger. It can be represented in several ways and there can be more than one token on one ledger. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is NFT? </summary>
NFT are non-fungible tokens. Meaning that they are tokens of one type, but each not interchangeable, each with their own characteristics. For example, a collectable stamp is an example of NFT. All stamps are... stamps. But each stamp has its own characteristics, value and history.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's bandwidth? </summary>
Bandwidth is the amount of information someone can pass through some resource at a given time frame. For example (which is a mere analogy), if I can move 5 stones from room A to room B in the space of one hour. Then we can say that my stone bandwidth is 5 stones per hour. Bandwidth in IT relates to information and the ability to pass a certain amount of data from one place to another.<br>
In cyber bandwidth plays a major role. It is a spam protection mechanism. It allows a user to only do a certain amount of transaction in a certain amount of time. Then, over time, it regenerates to give the user more ability to commit more transactions.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is Sybil resistance? </summary>
Sybil resistant means that it can withstand Sybil attacks. A Sybil attack is simply an attack on a system where the attacker uses a lot of pseudo (fake) identities to gain influence (usually, in terms of computational power) for himself.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is BFT? </summary>
FT is an abbreviation for Byzantine fault tolerance. It is a system that tackles the Byzantine general problem (a problem in which 4 generals need to come to an agreement of successfully attacking a city at the same time). In blockchains, each node (computer) needs to agree with one another on the current state of the network securely and efficiently. BFT is designed in such a way to help avoid the Byzantine generals problem. It is designed to achieve agreement even if some of the communicating nodes involved act maliciously. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary> What is POS? </summary>
Proof of Stake is the name of the consensus algorithm (way of agreeing) that is used in certain blockchain systems. Its main idea is to protect the system through the use of the stake of its participants. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary> What is staking?</summary>
Staking is the process of "locking" your tokens to receive rewards.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is the purpose of staking?  </summary>
The purpose of staking is network security. The tokens that are locked, the better for the system. This is done to prevent the so-called 51% attack. Which means that someone gains access to 51% of the resources and can then cheat the system in his favour. The rewards are the incentive which users receive for "locking" their tokens to protect the system.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Who or what are validators? </summary>
The validators are someone or rather a computer. Well, the word validator refers to both. Someone who runs a specific computer and the computer itself. Validators are making sure that all the transactions (communications) carried out in cyber are done correctly (i.e. that users aren't trying to cheat the system). Validators are auditable computers and their work is transparent. They have to reach consensus on the state of the ledger. And in cyber they compute (calculate) the knowledge graph that the users commit links to (they also commit links to the graph). For their work, they receive a reward from the blockchain. Which is automatically calculated by the system. Validators also participate in governance and can stake tokens to receive rewards. They can also stake delegators tokens and pay rewards out. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What or who is a delegator? </summary>
Delegators are uses that delegate their tokens to validators to participate in receiving staking rewards. For this validators might charge commission. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are smart contracts? </summary>
Smart contracts are programs that can program your protocol to behave in a certain way. For example, tell it to pay 10 coins to user A after he accomplishes a certain task. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a VM? </summary>
A virtual machine in computing is a computer system that allows one system to behave like another. In other words, it is a system inside another type of system. A real-world analogy would be the film "aliens". The alien is a VM in this case. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are knowledge graphs? </summary>
Knowledge graphs are a compilation of facts and information that provide meaning to a specific search result. I.E. if you search for Bitcoin, you might see a box on the side of the search results with lots of data about Bitcoin, what it is, where to get some, etc. This is essentially, the work of a knowledge graph. Currently, knowledge graphs use data from Wikipedia, Wikidata and other sources (which almost all, belong to google). 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's PageRank? </summary>
It is one of the algorithms used by google to rank search results. At a very basic level, it is based on the principle of counting incoming, quality links. Based on this information it decides what website should be ranked higher.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is web3? </summary>
Web3 is the next evolutionary step in the development of the web. A step that takes away from centralisation of search and social services and away from things that are depended on a single functioning unit (have a central source of authority). It is a step that desires to see involved counterparties and applications communicate directly one with another. In agreement with each other, whilst also, be motivated for this behaviour. And as a result, achieve a safer routing of data and packets (information exchange) on the web.<br>
Often, you might notice the term `Great Web` in our documents. For us, The Great Web is a much better-suited name for the more common term `web3`.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is IPFS?  </summary>
IPFS is a peer-to-peer (directly connected between two users) protocol, that is designed to make the web faster, safer, and more open. IPFS makes it possible to spread across high volumes of data and keeps every version of your files. IPFS makes it simple to set up networks for mirroring data. This means that data is pretty much immutable or if you may - everlasting.<br> 
IPFS helps to further distribute the web amongst peers (users). It enables constant availability — with or without internet connectivity. You can share and view files, manage large chunks of data, build applications, etc. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's governance? </summary>
Governance is the process via which the users of the ecosystem decide on what's going to be funded, how it is going to happen, etc. They do so via a voting mechanism.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a DAO? </summary>
A DAO is a decentralised autonomous organisation. It is a unity of users that mutually decided on the governance of something. This can be a protocol, a fund, an organisation, etc. A DAO does not have a physical representation. It is represented with the help of cryptography and code. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's Aragon? </summary>
Aragon is an application for creating decentralized, autonomous organisations backed by code rather than by centralised law. The distributed code becomes the law, where participating users have a say and an incentive for participating in the application/protocol. One may create global, bureaucracy-free organizations, companies, and communities with the help of Aragon. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are prediction markets? </summary>
Prediction markets are an example of communicating and financial incentives between actors (users) of an open market. A user can say "It is raining now" and back this information with data from a local weather station. Others may agree or disagree with this statement based on evidence provided by the initial predictor. He may put at stake his reputation or money. What this provides us with, is a system where rather than trusting a centralised source for providing certain information, we have a large number of independent sources, providing their opinion on a certain event with evidence. Hence, creating a provable and auditable service for some type of data (usually backed with a financial record).

  <summary>What is a hardware wallet in terms of crypto?  </summary>
There are numerous ways to store your cryptocurrency (tokens). There are hot wallets. A hot wallet is one with access to the internet. There are two categories. One is when you own your private key (the good way) and in the other - is when you don't own your private key. For example, if you keep your tokens on an exchange (that's a bad way - do not do this!). You should always remember one simple rule: `Not your keys - not your crypto!`<br> 
There are cold wallets. Which are pretty safe if are created following a normal set of guidelines (plenty of guides around the internet). A cold wallet is one that does not have access to the internet. This can be a paper wallet or a physical wallet (either a metal device or a hardware wallet that never had access to the net).<br> 
Finally, there are hardware wallets (they can also be hot or cold). A hardware wallet is a small digital device which requires physical access to make a transaction. Usually, they come in the form of a slightly bigger than your typical USB stick which you can connect to your PC and you need to press buttons physically on the device to do anything.  Of course, this drastically increases security, even if the device is considered hot.

### Introduction
**Q:** What is cyber? <br>
**A:** Cyber is a decentralized google, for provable and relevant answers.

**Q:** What is the main mission of cyber? <br>
**A:** Its mission is to create a universal search protocol to (a) build an open semantic field of the internet with the help of blockchain technology and cyberlinks, and (b) decentralize the infrastructure of the web with the help of blockchain

**Q:** What cyber is NOT? <br>
**A:** Cyber is NOT a commercial product. It is not a product as such. It is an instrument if you wish or a tool, that anyone can use. That said, cyber allows for several ways for its participants to earn rewards.
Cyber is NOT the new internet. It is a tool that can help to shape and to decentralize (distribute the power of authority) the new Great Web and the services it has to offer.

**Q:** How does cyber work? <br>
**A:** Cyber is, essentially, creating a brand new protocol (a procedure that helps computers to do things in a certain way) for adding and searching information onto a knowledge graph (a compilation of facts about something that provides meaning to the user). And rank this information. In other words, it's a decentralized google.

Users create links between 2 IPFS hashes (*hint: essentially, an IPFS hash is just a representation of some data*) and place them on a knowledge graph by spending bandwidth (amount of data that can be transmitted over a fixed period of time). Users also link IPFS hashes linked to keywords, which helps to enrich the knowledge graph with... *knowledge*.

That content is then dynamically ranked with the help of digital tokens and the current parameters of the networks load. This makes the rank dynamic (characterized by continuous change, activity, or progress).

All this is computed (determined with the help of a computer) by validators (a program or a computer that are responsible for checking the validity of something). The validators do so, by using their GPU's (literally - graphics cards).

This allows to search data on the web, rank it, query it (look it up) and create knowledge databases without blackbox intermediaries (third parties that try to censor data, hide or push specific results to obtain money, track your data, etc).

The interesting thing is that such a simple mechanism allows creating a lot of powerful tools as a result. We will go in-detail further down the document into those. For example: unified semantics, SEO instruments, autonomous robots, and a lot more.

**Q:** What is a relevance machine? <br>
**A:** Quite often throughout our explanations we refer to cyber as `A Relevance Machine`. The simple explanation lies in the meaning of the words themselves. cyber acts as a verifiable and provable intermediary for relevance between any two objects at any point and time. In other words, cyber can prove that A was relevant to B at a certain place, at a certain time and under specific conditions. 

When a user creates a cyberlink, he expresses the will to do so by backing this cyberlink with some weight in CYB tokens. In other words, the user submits to the knowledge graph what is important for him. The meaning extraction for knowledge in the case of cyber is incentivized. The submitted cyberlinks are dynamically ranked and project relevance to those who submitted them. 

Cyber uses Merkle trees to build proofs for the submitted links, creating a provable and auditable chain of information down to the root. The more agents inquire the knowledge graph, the more valuable the knowledge becomes. Based on this, the relevance between cyberlinks can be computed. Via querying and delivering answers in such fashion, a simple mechanism is constructed - the relevance machine. 

**Q:** Why cyber? <br> 
**A:** We like that name. That's one reason. We have been using this name throughout our projects for the past 6 - 7 years.

Actually, cyber refers to anything that is very smart. The meaning is rooted in the word cybernetics (check out this article on Wikipedia) - a science which describes the behaviour of dynamic systems with feedback loops.

In popular culture, it has become a partial synonym to all the crazy sci-fi things out there. Like the cyber-track by Elon Musk and co. Cyber refers to cyberspace. Space free from centralized, human influence and bureaucracy. It is the Andromeda of freedom. The last frontier...

### The history of cyber
The idea of cyber was incepted in late 2016. The original white paper was written by [@xhipster](https://github.com/xhipster) while still working with cyber·Fund. In 2017 a team of engineers began working on developing the project, that was then called cyber·Search. 

The idea behind cyber·Search was to create a blockchain agnostic explorer, that would enable anyone to search for any metadata within any blockchain. We have a small [retro landing page](https://cybercongress.github.io/cyber-search/) left from those days. 

After some time the team behind cyber·Search left and cyber~Congress was born. If you are curious, [watch those videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpI87MxJymc) to see how it happened (*hint: you can also watch some of the original cyber·Search videos on the same youtube channel*). 

(*hint: you may also see the [launch roadmap](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#full-launch-roadmap) for a historical timeline*)

The team was dedicating time to research and building. As time progressed, so did cyber·Search. The team grew, the idea grew and eventually, the results of good research, skilled engineering and the development of blockchain technology, led to the transformation of cyber·Search - into cyber, along with the birth of cyber~Rank, the mechanism that ranks information in cyber.  

The idea grew bigger and bigger until at one point it became what it is today. cyber wasn't an explorer anymore, it was now a global and innovative search mechanism for the new web.

The current white paper took 3 years of work to complete. The team that stands behind cyber changed pretty much altogether, but the original idea of making a universal and an intelligent search still stands (*hint: you can see the current team [here](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/teams/cybercongress.toml)*). 

The idea of cyber is still developing. But today it's not raw anymore. Today cyber has a clear vision of abolishing the chains of digital slavery through decentralizing the semantics of the web and its services.  

### The philosophy behind cyber
To understand cyber one first needs to understand its philosophy. Our work isn't simply technical. We base our work on our values. If it wasn't for them, we were not be building cyber. To be completely open about our intentions, I will jump into the story of the team behind cyber, and how values are our core driver. The core team knows each other for several years and has worked together previously. At one point, a few years ago we separated our ways, only to realize that whatever we do, we do not share values of others, hence, bringing the team back together.

What do we believe in? Firstly we believe in freedom, privacy and decentralization. We share and propagate the vision of improving this world. We believe that evil stands behind a centralized, bureaucratic approach to technology, governance, communication protocols (money), etc.

We do believe in code. We believe in innovation and in making use of our knowledge to make the world a slightly better place for our children. With that in mind, what we are trying to say, is that cyber and cyb are not just technological results. They are much more. At its base lay the values of the team behind cyber. We hope that our project can re-create certain values of what we believe the blockchain paradigm stands for. 

*Q&A on the philosophy behind cyber:*

<details>
  <summary>What problem are you trying to solve? </summary>
We are trying to solve the problem of data centralization and data censorship. Which in other words, is the decentralization of common knowledge (assuming that data is the new knowledge and that we are moving into the digital age).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why are you doing this?  </summary>
Each person should be able to control their own data, their identity, their knowledge. The universe can become a better place if our children live in a digital environment where they are in charge of their actions.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's wrong with google?  </summary>
google is a brilliant idea. We do not deny this. But google is the rebel that has overthrown the dictator and became the dictator itself. google uses you to shape the essence and the fundamentals of communications between everyone and everything. Whilst at it, google doesn't care for anyone and will make money on your action and your behalf.<br>
It should be noted, that by this question I am attempting not just at google, but at all the mega-digital corporations. Feel free to check out what this can lead to in the shape of [Cambridge Analityca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica). If this case is too much to take in or too "loud" for you, feel free to watch some episodes of Black Mirror to see how digital control can "break" society.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why now? </summary>
Because we are almost done with post-industrialism. We are slowly and surely moving into the digital realm. One can deny or accept this. Now is the time to either have the tools that will help us to shape the matrix the way we want to shape it or give those powers away to someone to control all aspects of our lives.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why search? </summary>
Search is a global mechanism that is globally understood by everyone, regardless of language, race, age, etc. It is somewhat a basic instinct (searching for food to survive, etc). In the digital realm with the help of search, we gain answers to our questions, which we always ask. Search helps us to build a model around any subject that is of interest to us. With the use of search, we can build databases, which can lead to a great number of useful instruments (on these later).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Aren't there other, more important problems to solve? </summary>
There probably are. But we decided to focus on this because we understand how to achieve the required result. There are probably more problems and questions to be solved (like hunger, wars, ecology, etc). Our tool can help to play a role in solving if not all, but some of these.  
  </details>
  
<details>
  <summary>Aren't there other things out there that solve this? </summary>
There is a lot of awesome, open-source technology on the market that can commit to making a change in the world. Most of the technology we use is not something we invented (although the code itself is written from scratch!). They are technologies that have existed previously and are awesome at doing what they do. Our software is a combination of existing technologies, protocols and our work that has arisen from this. It is specifically targeted at fixing what is broken.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How can users/developers/others benefit from using such a system in comparison to google, etc?  </summary>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/7hX2GbQC/cyber.png" />
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why do you need consensus within Cyber? </summary>
A consensus is required for nodes to agree on the current state of the ledger at any given point of time. This is needed to achieve security, transparency, immutability and decentralization. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is your take on: privacy/censorship/routing? </summary>
We believe that privacy should be a fundamental right. As of now, the protocol is pseudo-private (just like Bitcoin is). I.E. you know which hash linked something and with what weight, but you don't know the real name of the user. With that, we are planning to implement full privacy into the protocol.<br>
We are strongly discouraged by any censorship and view it as a sin against any living and/or thinking organism.<br> 
Routing should be always permitted. Transactions should always be permitted to pass. Otherwise, this is censorship. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do you not think that the motto #fuckgoogle is offensive? </summary>
Fuck no! Fucking is not for pain, it's for pleasure!
</details>

### The cyber~Congress DAO and its role
You already learned about the inception of cyber~ Congress. If you missed it, catch the videos of the birth of the original cyber~Congress [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUfxwbONrtEFeCHOA3gHT-g/videos).

cyber ~Congress was set up as a DAO. The initial intentions of cyber ~Congress can be found [in this document:`the evolution of species`](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/README.md). Today that manifest is still being worked on and is still in development. 

cyber~Congress helps to launch the protocol, commits to the code base, helps to gather the initial community, write the initial documentation, organise the distribution and deploy the Genesis. The Congress lives in Ethereum, as an Aragon DAO. It is responsible for organising the Game of links and the minting of THC tokens.

As of today, cyber~Congress is a 2/2 DAO for decision making and a 2/3 DAO in terms of security. However, it should be noted, that some decisions are already wider diversified as the whole team that works on the DAO takes part in most of the decision. In the future, we hope this will become automatized and the DAO will grow. 

There are 3 points on which we should touch when discussing cyber~Congress:
1) cyber~ Congress is the launching DAO behind cyber. For its work, a 14.3% share of the governing token, THC, is allocated to cyber~Congress. This share will be staked during cyber ~Auction to receive an equal amount in CYB tokens. This means that the congress will be a functioning entity in the life of the protocol. However, cyber is a community governed protocol. From the numbers above, one can tell, that the majority of the stake is going to be in the hands of the community. The protocol will be governed by the validators and the community via a governance mechanism, proposals and prediction markets.   

2) The manifest outlies the idea that all species should (and will) have an equal opportunity for secure and transparent communication. Intelligence can be simplified to communication. All species can communicate via electromagnetic impulses (including robots). If they can communicate (which they can), they can prove their existence and pass on a signal and receive an answer. This is intelligence at its most pure form. The main mission of cyber~Congress is `To help the evolution of species!`

3) cyber~Congress as a DAO plans on developing cyber, taking part in the governance, launching `cyber~FundClassic`, an ecosystem development fund, that will help cyber to evolve (*hint: further in the document, a whole section is dedicated to the description of the ecosystem*), form strategic partnerships and buidl applications. The DAO plans to stake the received ATOM tokens from the first donation round to its Cosmos [fuckgoogle validator](https://cosmos.bigdipper.live/validator/cosmosvaloper1e859xaue4k2jzqw20cv6l7p3tmc378pc3k8g2u), and support the incentives of the team via the received rewards. The DAO also plans to have a sustainable income flow, described in [this issue](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues/302).

## :computer: Section subtitle: Prepare for take-off

>  Masters become masters when they learn. You are done with exploring and are ready to buckle up your seat belt. It ain't Kansas no more...

This section will get you acquainted with all the bits and bobs there are to cyber. This includes all of our projects, our community plans, the launch process and how to get some fuel to bootstrap yourself to save the galaxy, most importantly this section teaches you how to become a hero and validate cyber!

### Using cyber: The very basics of becoming a master
#### cyber~Page
We suggest you start your acquaintance with using cyber from [cyber.page](http://cyber.page/). It is a small taste (it is, currently, in alpha mode) of an IPFS based search application, that allows one to search for semantically enriched and dynamically ranked IPFS content, with the help of the cyber protocol.

First of all, one needs to watch the short, Episode 1 story at the beginning (giggles are on us), by clicking `Play story` (just press the space bar on your keyboard if you wish to skip the story):

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/KzPkY6qv/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-14-45-15.png" />

Just turn on the speakers and enjoy the journey:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/85NWLkrr/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-14-47-34.png" />

You are now on the main page. Rest assured, it's working. Let me remind you that when google introduced their notorious sear bar, people were ready to kill. We think simple is good. Black is sexy:

(Notice how the eye in the top right corner is not red, but green? This is because since those screens were taken, we have integrated an IPFS node into the app, which lets you pin and search content right from a P2P network)

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/6q7QvFzv/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-14-49-02.png" />

Try clicking the search box in the middle and search for something original like `cyber`:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/yxzZ717N/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-14-51-12.png" />

This will return some results:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/RV3DBcjW/Screenshot-from-2020-03-24-18-51-12.png" />

Those are sparks (snippets), containing cyberlinked hashes, that someone linked, enriched semantically and here they are. The numbers next to the hashes are the current ranks.

The sparks don’t look fantastically attractive. But they will be later. They will even be alive and P2P-style interactive in the future. Let’s click on one of the results (please be patient, the network is still slow and the first time around it might take a while until something loads - this is peer discovery. More so, there is a possibility something won’t even load, as it was unpinned):

(Of course, the results are dynamic, the first hash led me to the cyber WP. Let us know what results you got)

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/DwY5nXHy/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-14-56-16.png" />

BTW, did you notice the paper clip next to `paste a hash`?  Because there is an integrated IPFS node, you can actually pin anything you want to IPFS using this paper clip and it will become immediately searchable thanks to cyber. I will go over in detail on how to do this next time (let's see if you can figure it out on your own for now).

Let’s click on the brain. That purple essence in the top left corner:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/YqQhpKP4/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-14-58-58.png" />

This will take us onto the main knowledge page:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/GtcSH1Qc/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-15-00-01.png" />

Here, you may explorer network statistics, validators, economic parameters, % of staked tokens, bandwidth price, etc. To do this, simply click on any of the buttons. I.E. `Cybernomics`, `Bandwidth`, etc

Notice that the top box, at the top, becomes searchable. You can perform search actions from here too. More so, cyber doesn't just understand keywords, it also understands addresses. For example, try searching an ATOM or an ETH address:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/QM0M3GTk/Screenshot-from-2020-03-24-19-02-40.png" />

It does say that it doesn't know what it is but notice the `Check your gift` button underneath. Click it. This will, most likely, take you to the gift page:

(Cyber gifted 10% of its supply to [ETH](https://www.ethereum.org/), [ATOM](https://cosmos.network/) and [URBIT](https://urbit.org/) hodlers)

If the address was lucky and got gifted, you will see something like this:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/vTRTP7np/Screenshot-from-2020-03-24-19-04-23.png" />

Give it a second to load and calculate the results. The page loads the results from a decentralized database (a blockchain), it can take up to a few seconds to calculate this.

(Otherwise, the results will display gift:0)

You can also click `PLAY`, which will take you to the [GoL rules](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/). The currently incentivized testnet of cyber. 

Now, try clicking the robot in the top right corner: 

(Notice, that when you hover over it, it displays text with links, feel free to explore them)

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/4x9nxKxQ/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-15-10-44.png" />

This takes you to the Ledger page:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/0rgRWN19/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-15-12-14.png" />

If you click the bottom button `Put Ledge into the pocket`, it will offer you to connect your Ledger (on this, later on, with different guides):

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/jd8kS5F2/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-15-14-03.png" />

Notice that the network is still learning, so if you type in something cyber isn't aware of yet, you will be displayed with this:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/gk93qPLs/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-15-15-24.png" />

However, you will see a result. This is a hash that takes you to an explanation page if you click it:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Qdf2WmYQ/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-15-17-12.png" />

Let's go back to the brain by clicking it:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/YqQhpKP4/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-14-58-58.png" />

Notice, how there is a message box, right under the top search box, saying you need tokens. Click on the `Game of Links` green link. This will take you here:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/25cLJsc1/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-15-19-38.png" />

Here, you may find details about the Game of Links, its distribution. Check out the `Masters path` (builder of the Great Web) or the `Heros path` (validators of the Great Web) by clicking on either. The results will help you to understand more details.

For now, we will finish the initial sign guide for [cyber.page](http://cyber.page/). When you use this guide, you might discover that since its inception, new features have been added. Even now, some pages like the [governance page](https://cyber.page/governance), are already being tested.

#### cyb~Virus
The virus is a Chrome extension made to #fuckgoogle right in Chrome. It was originally made as a project during an IPFS hackathon and since then, due to technical reasons, been archived. 

cyb~Virus is capable of downloading any web2 page into IPFS and enriching it with a searchable keyword for cyber in 2 clicks. However, due to technical limitations, we have archived the project. 

You may still find the code in its GitHub repository.

Please note: it is NOT safe to import your private keys into the app. We cannot guarantee the security of this application for the time being!

#### cyb~Snap
Snaps are a [metamask](https://metamask.io/) extensions that allow developers to integrate non-Ethereum chains into metamask and use it. To install snap you need to manually upload it from GitHub to your browser extensions.

cyb~Snap will allow integrations for almost all Cosmos based chains and act as a multi-chain wallet, just like metamask is for ETH. 

For cyber snap will allow for linking content from web2 to web3 via a few clicks. It will also act as a wallet and will allow utilizing other features.

A dev preview of cyb~Snap:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/YCF6VQ6p/ER42d-Fl-Wk-AAGn-GI.jpg" />

To be continued...

#### Using your Ledger to link and send tokens
The main purpose of cyber is to cyberlink aka to create an open semantic field for web3 and to enrich the knowledge graph with... knowledge that can be used by anyone, anywhere, anytime. 

In the future, the process of making links will become easier and easier. Right now, there are plenty of bugs and fixes that cyber.page as an app undergoes. But, regardless of these, it works. So let's try to use our Ledger device and create a link:

First of all, you will need a Ledger, for the purpose of this guide I am assuming you have one. If you don't and you wish to acquire one, please do so only from trusted sources! I advise you to check the ledger [official webiste](https://www.ledger.com/) first for any local dealers near you in [this section](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/retailers/). Please note, that we are not affiliated with Ledger, so please make sure you double-check all of this yourself.

As a second step, you will need the Cosmos app installed on your Ledger. To do this, you will need to install [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/pages/ledger-live) (only do so from their website!). As Cosmos is not on the App Catalog by default, you will need to activate the developer mode.

Go to settings and simply allow dev mode `ON`:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/CxW9bCNk/1-9l-BQWse4k-F7-Nr-MCEXM32-Q.png" />

Once the developer mode is activated, you can come back to the app catalogue and you should normally be able to find Cosmos on the list:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/RhyL2dqT/1-741r-Qcm-FCs-L6gn-EMz8h-Wyg.png" />

Click `install` and you are ready to move on.

I advise you obtain some ATOM tokens, as you will need those to make transactions within Cosmos (not cyber). Still, it might be a good idea to test how staking and transacting works in Cosmos, as it is very to cyber.

For this guide, I will skip on how to use your ATOM wallet, as there are plenty of those you can find on web2 and maybe even in cyber, or link on of these to cyber yourself =)

Onto the next step. To create a link with Ledger, you will need some CYB or EUL (depending on whether it is a test or a live net) tokens. There are a few ways to obtain these:

1) Whilst this is still a testnet, you might as for some in the [fuckgoogle TG channel](https://t.me/fuckgoogle) and people might send you some
2) Get some from the faucet (to be continued)
3) Get some from [Kira's TG bot](https://t.me/kirainterex)
4) Obtain them by [running a validator node](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/validators/onboarding.md)
5) By [playing GoL](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/)
6) By participating in any of the rounds (to be continued)
7) Via claiming [a gift](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Gift%20FAQ%20and%20general%20gift%20information.md)

It seems, that the easiest way now is to use the bot to get some tokens (unless you had a gift). Then, simply send them to your own address (to be continued...). Your EUL or CYB address will be generated for you automatically the first time you connect your ledger device to the app. Let's do it.

Open cyber app:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/bY5Zk0LY/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-13-15-01.png" />

Click on the Green eye of the robot in the top right corner. This takes you to the Ledger page:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/0rgRWN19/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-15-12-14.png" />

If you click the button at the bottom, `Put Ledger into the pocket`, it will offer you to connect your Ledger (follow the steps on the screen):

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/jd8kS5F2/Screenshot-from-2020-02-14-15-14-03.png" />

After you connect your device, you will get to a page which will display your Cosmos address and your cyber address:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/ncMwwxvY/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-13-19-45.png" />

If you see EUL tokens and not CYB tokens, this means that the network is still in testnet, don't worry about this.

Your balance is most likely to be 0 unless you had a gift. If you did, you will have some tokens on your balance. If not, use one of the options above to obtain some tokens. When you make links you aren't spending any tokens. But, cyber is architectured with a bandwidth model. This means that every time you make a transaction (i.e. link) a portion of your tokens gets frozen. Your bandwidth regenerates over time, allowing you to make more transactions. This is a simple spam protection mechanism. 

From here, you can click your cyber address. This will take you to a menu where you can see your available balance, the links you made, what heroes (validators you vote for), any mentions, etc:

Try clicking `Cyberlinks`. If you haven't previously made any links. Nothing will appear here, of course. Lets finally try and link!

In the box at the top, type in a search word you want to create a link for. Let's say you want to link something about music, then you would type `music`. If you wanted to link something about proteins, you would type in `proteins`. Watch your caps and your plurals. For the time being cyber doesn't know how to work with either plurals or caps. This means that it searches for strictly what you type. I want to link something about rain:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/brPSSqqX/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-13-26-31.png" />

Hit enter. In this case, nothing was found: 

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/nzGc5Bf5/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-13-29-52.png" />

This means that cyber still doesn't know what rain is and I can enrich the knowledge graph. Good.

I wanna link a picture of rain, as I'm a visual person and I think that this will easily explain what rain is to whoever then searches for it. At the bottom of the page, you will see `paste a hash` and a paper clip:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/V6G2dkqv/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-13-31-44.png" />

Click the paper clip to upload a picture!

(Now, I advise uploading pictures that are free and don't have any restrictions. But this is up to you what you do)

When you click the paper clip it will take you to a normal upload page:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/NfwZFST1/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-13-34-50.png" />

Pick your image and click `open` in the appeared box!

You can see that it has the name of the image in the box at the bottom. To the right of it click `Cyberlink using Ledger`:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/15PYs6hB/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-13-35-45.png" />

If the Ledge device isn't connected, you will need to connect it as described above, if it is, you will see something like this:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/0jB7FLpb/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-13-37-21.png" />

Click `Cyber it`. As you can see the screen tells you to confirm that the transaction matches what is on your Ledger. Make sure it does and use your Ledger to move the arrows right until you confirm the info:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/8kytQY4p/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-14-46-18.png" />

When you get to the View or Sign transaction, move the arrow down by using the right button on Ledger and click `Sign transaction` by clicking both of the buttons simultaneously on your Ledger:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/4dHtD8xd/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-14-49-40.png" />

You will see a transaction submitted screen and it after a second or two, the page will reload with a result:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/XYvZM22b/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-13-43-31.png" />

We have taught cyber what rain is. Good!

Let's click the result. This will take us to a separate page and open your picture n IPFS:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/bwKq6LWL/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-13-44-23.png" />

Cool. But it seems to me that this picture is not obvious after all... The page is still open and I wanna upload an HTML page that will explain what rain is. I prepared an HTML page of a dictionary explanation of what rain is. It was very simple. I just found the page that I wanted to use, right-clicked on the page and clicked `save as`. This saved an HTML file of the page I choose. 

I can now go back to `paste a hash`:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/gjSW3K3V/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-13-47-53.png" />

And click the paper clip and upload the HTML file of rain. Click `Cyberlink using ledger` and follow the same steps as described above. The result is this:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/VNqPKwjL/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-13-49-28.png" />

Not perfect. I know... But at least there is a picture and a description of what it is we wanted to teach cyber. We have committed 2 links to the knowledge graph and anyone searches for `rain` will find our result. Anyone cyberlinking our rain to other things will be starting here. Pretty cool, ah? 

You can link videos, music files, pdfs, etc. The link is your oyster. For now, they do not show perfectly on screen and there are lots of fixes that the app is undergoing. But it fulfils its initial purpose. We managed to submit something to the open semantics field of web3. Who knows, maybe whatever we submitted will once become one of the most searched for things on the new Great Web...

As you guessed, by far this is not all the app is capable of. You probably noticed that it acts as an explorer, allowing you to check balances, transactions, vote for validators, etc. You can also send tokens by using the app and your ledger. Click on the green eye again:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/fRgf1Sf8/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-14-53-29.png" />

At the bottom of the page click `Send EUL using ledger` and follow the instructions:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/ZnTNWJL9/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-13-59-02.png" />

You will need to enter a valid cyber address that you want to send tokens to and the amount in GEUL (1 GEUL = 1 million EUL). Note that your balance is shown in GEUL. So to send 100k, enter 0.1:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/hjKvrpQ6/Screenshot-from-2020-03-25-14-01-21.png" />

After that click `generate transaction` and simply follow the instructions on your Ledger. When you made sure the information on it matches the info on your screen, hit `sign transactions`, just like when you were linking and the app will generate the tx. 

The app contains lots of features. Most of them are still experimental. As time and the app progress, I will add more guides to this section.

### IPFS / Cosmos & Tendermint
A lot of the time, cyber is asked: why Cosmos? Or why IPFS? <br>
Here are the answers:

 <details>
  <summary>How do you use IPFS? </summary>
   cyber uses IPFS as the current backbone on which users perform the search. Think about IPFS for cyber, as of the fridge, and cyber is the lightbulb inside of it. Users use IPFS to store and publish content and files. cyber lets users rank, index and find it. If there was no lightbulb, how would you find food in the fridge during those hungry nights?
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>Why is IPFS better than other protocols? </summary>
  cyber does not claim that something is better than something else. However, IPFS is revolutionary. It is the first protocol that created content-based addressing, which allowed cyber to build cyberlinks on top of it and change the way we search for information. 
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>What other protocols are you planning to use? </summary>
 cyber plans to be protocol agnostic. For both stateless protocols (in which no session information is retained by the receiver): IPFS, Swarm, DAT, Git, BitTorrent, or stateful, such as: Bitcoin, Ethereum, other blockchains and tangles. This means the cyber is smart enough to understand any type of protocol is taught and can truly become the backbone of search for the Great Web. 
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>Why do use Cosmos/Tendermint? </summary>
  (1) When we started to build Cosmos was already in mainnet. (2) Cosmos has IBC, a protocol that allows for data transfer between sovereign blockchains. (3) We share the decentralized, non-monolithic philosophy that Cosmos preaches. (4) The security of Tendermint and Cosmos-SDK is top-notch 
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>How do you use Cosmos? </summary>
  Cosmos provides the consensus mechanism for cyber. We use Tendermint as an engine that helps the network to reach agreement on its current state, perform transactions on the blockchain, validate search results, etc
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>Why don't you use Polkadot or other solutions? </summary>
  For now, others do not exist. Polkadot was still tested when we started. Also, we tend to agree more with the philosophy of Cosmos and we hope to be connected to Polka via bridges and relayers when they finally arise.
  </details>

### cyber~Metagalaxy
cyber is a galaxy of smaller components. Why? The simple answer, is why not? The other answer is that we want to divide the work evenly and equally amongst several entities that are each responsible for their field of work. Most importantly, this work has to be done efficiently, and breaking it up into smaller parts - helps a lot. A browser is an application, while the protocol is the protocol. They are not one entity. Same goes for the governing process. Different entities are responsible for different questions.

**A visualization of the metagalaxy:**

To be continued...

**Selected questions about the componnets that make up the galaxy:**  
  <details>
  <summary>What is cyber? </summary>
cyber is the name of the protocol that holds everything together. Think of it as black matter. 
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>What is cyberd? </summary>
cyberd is the name for the backbone of cyber and a name of the GitHub repository where the cyber protocol lives.
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>What is Cyb? </summary>
Cyb is your friendly robot/personal browser application. One one hand it is a mere browser. But it isn't. The problem is that there is no such word as of now that describes what cyb is exactly. It is a browser in the sense that it lets you search for things. But it is your personal applications, that can understand many other things. It can act as a wallet. It can act as a database. It contains your cyber-space robots. For now, we call this a browser. But I would imagine that something along - a personal customizable web application, provides a better description.
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>What is cyber~Page? </summary>
cyber~Page is the gateway of the protocol. It allows you to search for things. Obtain results. View statistics. Use governance procedures. It is part of Cyb.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>What is dot~Cyber? </summary>
dot~Cyber is another name for cyber.page: a reference interface for the cyber protocol.
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>What is cyber~Congress? </summary>
The congress is the DAO behind the launch of the protocol. The initial intentions of cyber~Congress can be found in the Evolution of Species. The congress helps to launch the protocol, commits to the code base, helps to gather the initial community, write the initial documentation, organise the distribution and deploy the Genesis. The Congress lives in Ethereum, as an Aragon DAO. It is responsible for organising the Game of links and the minting of THC tokens. The congress will launch the protocol, hand it over to the community and remain a functioning entity that commits to the code, improves the protocol and makes it an intergalactic product.
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>What are the distribution games? </summary>
This is described in a separate section in detail. In short, those are the technical games that help cyber~Congress and cyber to achieve a better distribution for the protocol and the governance tokens.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>What is the vesting app? </summary>
The vesting application is an app used to vest your tokens during cyber~Auction and claim a 1-1 equivalent amount of tokens in the cyber blockchain after the end of the auction. 
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>What is governance in cyber? </summary>
The cyber protocol is governed by its users. We will talk about specifics further. But, the idea is that it is the users that should decide, by coming to a majority agreement, on what is and should be happening in terms of development, what rewards they should receive, how should a certain something work and so on.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>What is cyber~Foundation? </summary>
It is a community governed DAO. The role of cyber~Foundation is to help the community govern the protocol via an Aragon DAO. It is a fund managed via a decentralized engine, charged with the donated ETH and managed by the community (agents of the protocol).
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>What is cyber~Ecosystem? </summary>
It is the entity that is responsible for helping to grow the ecosystem. Its common goal: to build a better and a unique new web: the Great Web. To achieve this it will help to form partnerships, onboard communities, help research, connect people, do VC work when necessary, create and review documentation, participate in the governance, help to validate and build the chain and its applications.
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>Who are cyber~FundClassic? </summary>
It is the future fund to be created and to help applications grow within the cyber ecosystem, with the help of cyber~Congress and cyber~Foundation. 
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>What is cyb~Virus? </summary>
The virus is a chrome extension (in the future this may apply to other web2 browsers). Its idea is to demonstrate the ability of cyber to download, save and rank any content from web2 to web3. We use chrome because we like irony. The idea to fuck google right in google's playground fascinates us.
  </details>

   <details>
  <summary>What is the brain? </summary>
The brain is the explorer of cyber. It shows transactions and statistics.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>What is gravity? </summary>
Gravity is a librabry that contains the visual components of cyb.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>Whats Chaingear? </summary>
Chaingear is one of our secret weapons. It is not yet fully described by us. But in its essence, it is an ETH based ability for anyone to create a personal or a public database with the help of NFT tokens. For example, one may create the database .porn and then create records in that database. I.E. world.porn, and yes, it works just like a domain-based structure. But it's not a domain-based structure, as it allows you to create other types of databases too.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>What are crawlers? </summary>
Crawlers will become tools that help masters and builders of the Great Web to migrate knowledge from web 2 to the new metaverse.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>Who is cyber~Admin </summary>
cyber~Admin is an intelligent bot that helps the cyber~Cogress team to work. In fact, he is a full member of the team.
  </details>

### cyber~Ecosystem
The cyber~Ecosystem is a subdivision of the metagalaxy. The ecosystem division is working towards a common goal: to build a better and a unique new web: `The Great Web`.

The coordination of efforts include:
- helping to create a validator pool
- helping to build communities
- connecting teams
- helping R&D
- cross-promote products and protocols
- provide strategic grants in the future
- creating and taking part in governance proposals
- VC and partnerships
- creating useful and unique documentation
- working towards a common goal

To get familiar with the cyber~Cosystem, we strongly suggest you read the [ecoystem development paper](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md), which includes a view on the development of cyber ~Ecosystem, describe what it is, its goals, values and participants. It should also offer theoretical and practical metrics that can measure the success of the proposed building blocks that will form the growth of the ecosystem. 

Full information about the ecosystem can be found in [the transparency folder](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/tree/master/ecosystem) of the congress repository.

#### Community
The work of the ecosystem is made out of various blocks, including:
- [Community work](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md#community-work): One of the main goals is to form a community of scientists, geeks, researches, validators, hackers, web3 agents and users as such (of any other possible category) for Cyber. The goal is to target all of [the relevant communites](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues/289), by which we mean a spectre of modern and efficient computers and their communities, rather than the foundations or organizations standing behind those projects
- [Cyberc-n](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md#cyberc0n): cyber~Congress has already organised one [self-governing event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfG_mn6psRQ&list=PL-MRS5fkWajCmfAS1WxBVgtMdFPmS4WTZ). Its goal is to achieve a completely sovereign and a self-ruling entity, that humans can help to run
- [Friendly aliens and partenrships](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md#friendly-aliens-and-partenrships):  We need to form strategic partnerships. We believe that developing Cyber means developing computing, rather than developing foundations behind those computers. This means that we will, first of all, look for similar values with our future allies
- [Governance and proposals](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md#governance-and-proposals): This means community governance for pretty much everything. Building applications, developing the protocol, onboarding projects, etc
- [Hacking and open-source](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md#hacking-and-open-source): If there is one thing that we believe in more than all else, it is probably open-source. Hence, we understand the value of building a community of open-source contributors
- [Research and R&D](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md#research-and-rd): We want to prove that our vision of the [Evolution of spicies](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/README.md) can and will uphold. All this requires research. A lot of research. Open-source, funded research that will benefit, not just Cyber, but will benefit the world.
- [VC](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md#vc): All this requires funds. As much as we would love for all to simply help us, distribute our tokens and let the beast live - we are aware that we are leaving in a world spun by money, which in itself isn't bad. Money is simply a communication protocol, alas - one that is broken
- [cyber~FundClassic](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md#cyberfundclassic): This fund will be funded out of the personal bag of cyber~Congress and its team members that wish to fund it. However, we believe that a further option of having community members also help to fund should remain open. The idea of the fund is to help buidl applications on top of the protocol
-[The important generation](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md#the-important-generation): We have stated on many occasions that we must concentrate on younger generations, not simply because they are the users and the engineers of tomorrow. That is, of course - one reason. But the reality is that the young (and the coming) generation has a completely different recognition of what we do. And that is a good thing

#### Communication flow & Blog
We believe that communication is uber important, hence we define a [communciation proccess](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/teams/communication%20and%20publishing.md) in which we describe the importance of communicating via [cyber~Blog](https://cybercongress.ai/post/) to the [relevant communities](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues/289).

cyber~Congress strongly values the importance of reports, we describe our flow of reporting in [this document](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/teams/team%20reports.md).

We also communicate via other arteries described below:

#### Congress website & cyber.page
The main gateway to cyber is, of course, [cyber.page](https://cyber.page/), an interface reference to the whole protocol. This is our main landing and targeting page. A road to Rome. Here you will find everything you need to know in order to use cyber. 

We also have a [website](http://cybercongress.ai/) for the DAO behind the launch of cyber: cyber~Congress. On this website you can find information about our projects, some basic statistics and, most importantly [technical docuamnetation](https://cybercongress.ai/docs/cyberd/cyberd/) for cyber and cyb, the [forum](http://ai.cybercongress.ai/) and the [blog](https://cybercongress.ai/post). Via this website and our [GitHub](https://github.com/cybercongress) cyber ~Congress communicates with the outer world. 

#### GitHub
Of course, everything we do is 100% open-source. Hence GitHub. Our [GitHub](https://github.com/cybercongress) contains many useful repositories filled with love, code and documentation, including the document you are reading right now. 

If you are looking for releases, code sources, want to help us via an issue or a pull request, this is the place to be. Also, this is the quickest place to get an answer to any question you have to the cyber~Congress team.

#### Gitcoin
We believe in progress. We value contribution. We believe that we need to learn to help one another. This is why we want to develop the [Gitcoin program](https://gitcoin.co/profile/cybercongress) inside of cyber. Every sprint we try to allocate a certain amount of ETH and distribute it between our team members to actively use gitcoin.

<a href="https://gitcoin.co/explorer?q=cyberd">
 <img src="https://gitcoin.co/funding/embed?repo=https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberd">
</a>

#### Cyberc-n
Off-line events allow communities to grow stronger. Hackathons and useful conferences can help to build-up new teams together, allow form fabulous new creations. A perfect example of how awesome events shape the world was DEVCON-0, but we believe we can do much better.

cyber~Congress ha already organised one [self-governing event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfG_mn6psRQ&list=PL-MRS5fkWajCmfAS1WxBVgtMdFPmS4WTZ). To our knowledge, it was the first world conference to be run by a smart contract. We think that this is how it should be. And just as others, we learn our lessons.

In our plans for the coming year, to organise Cyberc1n. It will be a completely sovereign and a self-ruling entity, that humans can help to run. No more boring and long speeches. We plan entirely new formats, with whiteboards, geeks and ~blakc-jack~ coding.

#### Evangelists
The idea of an evangelist is to preach about cyber. To bootstrap this we created the Open Bootstrap Evangelism Program (OBEP), which after the bootstrap will, hopefully, carry on thanks to governance commitments and the community pool.

_Mission:_ Increase initial traction. Build strong local and/or online community
_Tooling:_ cyber tools that help. Creativity
_General Tasks:_ Translations. Creations of chats. Groups. Meetups. DR (donation relations). Governance. Hackathons. Etc

For this cyber~Congress has allocated a community pool and set out guidelines, during the bootstrap. Details can [be found here](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues/307). For us this is a long term relationship, so, we will create a distributed Evangelist network, that will be funded in CYB tokens from the ecosystem ~Fund via governance. 

#### Meetups & Hackathons
One of the main goals for cyber~Congress and the evangelist team will be to create useful and meaningful meetups, where people will onboard to cyber. This can be enhanced by Hackathons and other offline initiatives from the community.

#### Partnering communities
There are many importnat communities that cyber sees as vital for the success of building `the Great Web`. The idea behind publishing these, is that you may copy this list or print it out and help cyber to get more traction within these communitites. Feel free to include any [mentions here](https://ai.cybercongress.ai/t/mentions-of-the-beast-in-the-wild/)

### Launch process
As of writing this document, cyber is still in public testing. The current public, incentivized testnet is `euler-5`, it is also the chain-id.

The launch of cyber considers many different aspects, and we believe that to grasp cyber fully, one must also be familiar with the launch process. This is also a move to cement the launch process as a transparent event.

In this section, we will concentrate on the period of post-euler-5 and up to the end of cyber~Auction, which ends 500 days after the launch of the mainnet. However, the full process is described below.

#### Full launch roadmap
- 2016: [First WP draft](https://github.com/xhipster/cyber-origin/blob/master/cyber%E2%80%A2Chain.md), research, self-funding (this part applies throughout the current lifetime of the protocol)
- 2017: One of the first, public [presentations](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nsPwHLBu5UArQ4zbN1yaGUj8LBgEpCEFqVe6iKP5XLg/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.g20ef74535d_0_33) of cyber·Search
- 2017: Evolution of cyber~Search into cyber, development work
- 2018: Protocol development, first implementations
- 2018.11.10 - 2019.03.05: Launch of the `Winter round for friends` public [donations](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/26a33ce5ed92204f67c79dd8036690019bcf3f89/friends/winter.md), protocol development, public testing
- 2019: Protocol development, public testing
- 2019.01.31: Release of [euler-1](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberd/releases/tag/v0.1.1)
- 2019.06.28: The release of [Barcelona](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb/releases/tag/0.1.4), cybs demo for the IPFS community
- 2019.12.02: Release of the final [White Paper](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmceNpj6HfS81PcCaQXrFMQf7LR5FTLkdG9sbSRNy3UXoZ)
- 2019.12.20: [Launch of Game of Links and euler-5](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/pull/316/files#diff-41de23aee25953091ba5a3c0ae012855)
- Here and thereafter the dates are subject to change due to dynamic properties and development work
- 2020, end of winter - the beginning of spring: Launch of governance and vesting apps/modules
- 2020, spring: Launch of public donation round
- 2020, 90 days or 600k ATOM after the previous event: End of Game of Links
- 2020, (presumably) summer: Launch of the mainnet and Game of thrones
- 2020, and for a period of 21 days after the launch of the mainnet: Game of Thrones
- 2020 - 2021, after Game of Thrones: cyber~Auction, which lasts for 479 days

If you are interested in the development roadmap, please see the [projects roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/cybercongress/projects/2). It is broken into episodes. Each episode contains the main current tasks. Each task may contain multiple intenral tasks, which in turn live in their own repositories. Episodes do not have a specified timeline.

#### Distribution games introduction
The distribution games are a way of improving the distribution of tokens to a higher number of participants in a fairer way through a gamified process. There are 3 distribution games proposed in total. Their goal is to help increase the initial efficiency of the distribution.

**Q:** What is Game of Links (GoL)?<br>
**A:** The name is partially self-explanatory here. The idea is to distribute tokens based on several parameters (disciplines within the game). Those include not just linking but some other technical things. The simple idea behind this is to make the protocol better at the start and to make sure tokens are distributed to those who are interested most in the success of the idea (initial believers).

**Q:** What is Game of Thrones (GoT)? <br>
**A:** It's a game where one community of hodlers tries to outbid the other in return for receiving a larger discount. 10% of CYB supply is allocated per each competing community. 100 TCYB to the ATOM community for donating ATOM. And an equivalent amount to the ETH community, which will initially receive THC tokens that they can lock during the auction in exchange for CYB tokens (in other words the ETH donators can potentially receive both THC and CYB tokens). The game will last for 21 days.

**Q:** What is cyber~Auction?<br>
**A:** cyber ~Auction is part of the initial distribution games. If the first two focus on specific target groups (although anyone is free to participate). The goal of cyber ~Auction is to focus on all types of users. It will take place after the end of the previous games.

The auction will last for 500 rounds that last for 23 hours each (a little over 479 days). Every round has 1 billion THC is at skate. The more you donate and the less has been donated by others on that same day the more you can gain. After the end of the distribution, participants will be able to unlock their THC tokens and use them as they wish, e.i. transfer, trade, etc. As a result of the auction, the community will have access to all the donated ETH within the Aragon organization.

One more mega important part of the auction to remember, are the creative powers of THC. If you vest your THC tokens for the period of the auction - you receive 1 CYB token for each locked THC token for the duration of the auction!

*(Hint: A thorough guide on the games is in the beep, beep, beep section) 

#### The launch protocol and initial GoL details
For the slightly technically advanced users, there is a [laucnh-kit repository](https://github.com/cybercongress/launch-kit) that can take you through each part of the Genesis launch protocol. Here, we will concentrate on the main parts of it.

Here is the full visualization of the launch protocol:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/mDcz3JRV/launch-protocol-v2.png" />

And, here you can see the details of the launch process from euler-5, to the end of Game of Thrones:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/QN9nR8hm/timeline.png" />

#### Lucnh FAQ

  <details>
  <summary>Why the procedure is so complex? </summary>
 It isn't. It might seem like this to the naked eye. The reasons behind it are the desire to separate each detail of the protocol and work on it thoroughly, to use all of the experience that our team has and not to repeat the mistakes of other projects.
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>Can you describe the launch process in a paragraph? </summary>
From 2016-2019 we were working on researching, developing and publicly testing the protocol. At the end of 2019, we launched the first leg of the distribution games, made to increase initial traction, test the protocol and achieve good distribution. The first part is the game of links, which is an incentivized game with different technical disciplines and a public donation round in ATOMs to the cyber~Congress DAO. The second parts are made out of Game of Thornes, the game between ETH and ATOM communities to outbid each other and get more tokens from cyber~Congress, and cyber ~Auction, the 479-day long auction, in equal windows with public ETH donations to the community DAO governing the protocol. GoT is window 0 of the auction. The auction takes part after the launch of the mainnet.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>How to get involved at this stage? </summary>
Play the Game of Links. launch a validator. Submit links to the knowledge graph. Helps us to get traction. Become an evangelist. Help us to test the governance, etc.
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>Do you have a White Paper? </summary>
Yes, it can be found via this IPFS link: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmceNpj6HfS81PcCaQXrFMQf7LR5FTLkdG9sbSRNy3UXoZ
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>When are you launching a stable mainnet? </summary>
The network will launch when Game of Links is done (the other 2 games are held after the launch). There are 146 active validators and all the tokens are distributed. As of the end of 2019, the ETA is summer 2020. We strongly encourage participation when GoL kicks-off!
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>Who are the people behind the project? </summary>
We are a team of geeks, enthusiasts, thinkers, hackers and people who firmly believe in what they want to achieve. If you wish to, you can skim through our GitHub and easily find links to some of our public profiles (like keybase) and much more information about each one of us. All of us can be reached here or on our forums.
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>How do I contact you? </summary>
Via our GitHub, via our forum or our TG chat. All links are at the end of this document. 
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary> So, How do I use it?</summary>
Please see the Using cyber: the very basics section for this.
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>What is the fastest way to get tokens? </summary>
Play the Game of course! Another quick way is to use future faucets or Kira's TG bot, which you can find on our TG channel.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>How many tokens do I need to start using cyber? </summary>
There isn't a specific amount of tokens you need to use the network. This is a very dynamic property. The current statistics can be viewed on cyber.page. It should be noted that all transactions require bandwidth (resources). However, transactions don't spend your tokens. The tokens "freeze" for some time, after which, they are released back to the user. This is a spam protection mechanism.
  </details>
  
 <details>
  <summary>Can I contribute? </summary>
Other than in the ways described in the section about how to get involved, you may also try to solve issues, submit PRs or help us with research. 
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>Will I be rewarded for my contributions? </summary>
There are several ways someone can get rewarded:
We actively use GitCoin. This means that we fund some of our tasks and issues. If you are an open-source developer, you can solve issues and get rewarded.
We constantly announce grants for open-source development and research. For example our Urbit open-source proposal
You can gain social weight and social reputation by becoming an early adopter (please make conclusions for yourself, as to what this might gain).
If you run a validator node, you are entitled to receive rewards that are described above.
You can take advantage of the community pool.
You can be a part of the OBEP. 
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>Is this an ICO? </summary>
The projects receive donations from users who wish to donate them and participate in the distribution games. The process can be referred to as an initial community offering. Which is the process where the community understands the value of the proposed idea and decides to donate towards its development for its own benefit.
  </details>
  
   <details>
  <summary>Why do you need donations? </summary>
Thanks to ATOM donations we want to secure a commitment for cyber~Congress in the development of both: Cosmos and Cyber ecosystems. ATOM donations will allow for cyber ~Congress to use staking rewards for continuous funding of the protocol without the necessity to dump tokens.
THC donations will be managed by an Aragon DAO (the community) to help develop the protocol in the longterm.
  </details>

## :nut_and_bolt: Section subtitle: Mama I'm an engineer
By now you should be somewhat familiar with what cyber is and its basics. In this section, we will learn to be engineers. At first, this section was meant to be part of the technical guides and the deep space section. But validating cyber is of uber importance, hence, before we move on, let's see how you can become amongst the first to validate `The Great Web` and earn rewards.

### Validating cyber
#### A cheat code
You may skip through this and jump straight to the [onboarding guide](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/validators/onboarding.md) for validators, which contains all of the links to mos of the information described below.

#### Questions and answers
**Q:** How do I become a validator in Cyber? <br>
**A:** Make sure you have the requirements described in this document and follow this guide

**Q:** What do I need to become a validator in Cyber? <br>
**A:** Anyone can become a validator if he has the right hardware to run it. Right now, the requirements are as following:
- CPU: 4 cores (6 is better)
- RAM: 16 GB (64 would be better)
- SSD: 256 GB (512 is preferred)
- Connection: 100 Mbit fiber
- GPU: CUDA / GeForce 1070/80
- Software: Linux, Docker

**Q:** Do I need to become a validator?<br>
**A:** It is only up for you to decide if you do. As a validator, you will be entitled to receive rewards out of the inflation for committing your hardware.

**Q:** What are the incentives for becoming a validator?<br>
**A:** You can earn rewards and help to bootstrap the network by running a validator node. Apart from that:
- You can use your cards to take part in computing the knowledge graph and be a part of an interesting project
- You will be receiving rewards for running a validator, just like in Cosmos (ATOM)
- You will be eligible to build your reputation in the system and can participate in governance during the mainnet
- You can receive a commission from delegators on the mainnet
- You can take part in forming the knowledge graph of the new Great Web
- Become a web3 provider

 #### Become a hero: launch a node
 We call validators `Heroes`, this is because they are. They are the heroes that can help to set, run and maintain the right, distributed, open-source, desired infrastructure needed for `The Great Web`. To become a hero, follow the below guide.

*Note:* The current active testnet is `euler-5` (substitute <testnet_chain_id> with that value, do not forget to remove the `<` and the `>` symbols).

##### Prepare your server
First, you have to set up a server.
You should run your validator node all the time. This means that you will need a reliable server to keep it running.
Also, you may consider using any cloud service with dedicated GPU, like Hetzner (or a local machine).

Cyberd is based on Cosmos SDK and written in Go.
It should work on any platform which can compile and run programs in Go.
However, we strongly recommend running the validator node on a Linux server.

Rank calculation in cyberd is beneficial to GPU computation.
They are easy to parallelize. This is why it is best to use GPU.

Recommended requirements:
```js
CPU: 6 cores
RAM: 32 GB
SSD: 256 GB
Connection: 100Mb, Fiber, Stable and low-latency connection
GPU: Nvidia GeForce(or Tesla/Titan/Quadro) with CUDA-cores; at least 6gb of memory*
Software: Docker, Ubuntu 16.04/18.04 LTS
```

*Cyberd runs well on consumer-grade cards like Geforce GTX 1070, but expecting load growth we advise using Error Correction compatible cards from Tesla or Quadro families.*

But, of course, the hardware is your own choice and technically it might be possible to run the chain on "even - 1 CUDA core GPU", but, you should be aware of stability and a decline in calculation speed.

##### Third-party software
The main distribution unit for Cyberd is a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container. All images are located in the default [Dockerhub registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/cyberd/cyberd/). To access the GPU from the container, Nvidia drivers version *410+* and [Nvidia docker runtime](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) should be installed on the host system. For better user experience, we propose you use [portainer](https://portainer.io) - a docker containers manager. You can skip any subsection of this guide if you already have any of the necessary software configured.

##### Docker installation
Simply, copy the commands below into your CLI.

1. Update the apt package index:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

2. Install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:
```bash
sudo apt-get install \
     apt-transport-https \
     ca-certificates \
     curl \
     gnupg-agent \
     software-properties-common
```

 It may require installing `curl` - `apt-get install curl`

3. Add Docker’s official GPG key:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
```

4. Update the apt package index:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

5. Install the latest version of Docker CE and containerd or skip to the next step to install a specific version (as of Nov 2019 version 19.03 is required):
```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

If you don’t want to preface docker commands with sudo create a Unix group called docker and add users to that group. When the Docker daemon starts it creates a Unix socket accessible by members of the docker group.

6. Create the docker group:
```bash
sudo groupadd docker
```

7. Add your user to the docker group:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $YOUR-USER-NAME
```

8. Reboot the system for the changes to take effect.

##### Portainer installation (optional)
1. Before installing Portainer, download the Portainer image from the DockerHub using the docker pull command below:
```bash
docker pull portainer/portainer
```

2. Now, run Portainer by using the simple docker command from below:
```bash
docker run -d --restart always -p 9000:9000 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock portainer/portainer
```

3. Open your browser and go to:
```bash
localhost:9000
```

![portainer](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmS42MJxjUB7Cu1GoJeE6eBmWkjHTZdgiAUcX4Qqy9NR3M)

4. Create a username and set a password. Chose the `local` tab and click `connect`.
All the containers will be available in the `containers` tab on your dashboard.

##### Nvidia drivers installation
1. To proceed, first add the `ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa` repository into your system (you might see some warnings - press `enter`):
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
```

```bash
sudo apt update
```

2. Install Ubuntu-drivers:
```bash
sudo apt install -y ubuntu-drivers-common
```

3. Next, identify your graphic card model and the recommended drivers:
```bash
ubuntu-drivers devices
```

You should see something similar to this this:
```bash
== /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/0000:01:00.0 ==
modalias : pci:v000010DEd00001BA1sv00001462sd000011E4bc03sc00i00
vendor   : NVIDIA Corporation
model    : GP104M [GeForce GTX 1070 Mobile]
driver   : nvidia-driver-418 - third-party free
driver   : nvidia-driver-410 - third-party free
driver   : nvidia-driver-430 - third-party free
driver   : nvidia-driver-440 - third-party free recommended
driver   : xserver-xorg-video-nouveau - distro free builtin
```

4. We need the *410+* drivers release. As you can see v440 is recommended. The command below will install the recommended version of drivers:
```bash
sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall
```

Drivers will install for approximately 10 minutes.

```bash

##### Install Nvidia container runtime for docker
1. Add package repositories:
```bash
distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID)
```

```bash
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -
```

```bash
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list
```

You should see this:
```bash
deb https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/ubuntu18.04/$(ARCH) /
deb https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-container-runtime/ubuntu18.04/$(ARCH) /
deb https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/ubuntu18.04/$(ARCH) /
```

2. Install nvidia-docker2 and reload the Docker daemon configuration:
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
```

```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker

```

3. Test nvidia-smi with the latest official CUDA image:
```bash
docker run --gpus all nvidia/cuda:10.0-base nvidia-smi
```

Output logs should coincide as earlier:

Your machine is now ready to launch the fullnode.

##### Cyberd fullnode launching
1. Create folders for keys and data storing where you want, for example:
``` bash
mkdir /cyberd-dev/cyberd
mkdir /cyberd-dev/cyberdcli
```

2. Run the fullnode:
(This will pull and extract the image from cyberd/cyberd)
```bash
docker run -d --gpus all --name=euler-5 --restart always -p 26656:26656 -p 26657:26657 -p 1317:1317 -e ALLOW_SEARCH=true -v /cyberd-dev/cyberd:/root/.cyberd  -v /cyberd-dev/cyberdcli:/root/.cyberdcli  cyberd/cyberd:euler-5
```

3. After successful pulling of the container and launching, run to check if your node is connected to the testnet:
```bash
docker exec euler-5 cyberdcli status
```

A possible output looks like this:
```bash
{"node_info":{"protocol_version":{"p2p":"6","block":"9","app":"0"},"id":"93b776d3eb3f3ce9d9bda7164bc8af3acacff7b6","listen_addr":"tcp://0.0.0.0:26656","network":"euler-5","version":"0.32.7","channels":"4020212223303800","moniker":"anon","other":{"tx_index":"on","rpc_address":"tcp://0.0.0.0:26657"}},"sync_info":{"latest_block_hash":"686B4E65415D4E56D3B406153C965C0897D0CE27004E9CABF65064B6A0ED4240","latest_app_hash":"0A1F6D260945FD6E926785F07D41049B8060C60A132F5BA49DD54F7B1C5B2522","latest_block_height":"4553","latest_block_time":"2019-11-24T09:49:19.771375108Z","catching_up":false},"validator_info":{"address":"66098853CF3B61C4313DD487BA21EDF8DECACDF0","pub_key":{"type":"tendermint/PubKeyEd25519","value":"uZrCCdZTJoHE1/v+EvhtZufJgA3zAm1bN4uZA3RyvoY="},"voting_power":"0"}}
```

Your node has started to sync. If that didn't happen, check your config.toml file located at /<your euler-5 directory>/cyberd/config/config.toml and add at least a couple of addresses to <persistent_peers = ""> and <seeds = "">, some of those you can fing on our [forum](https://ai.cybercongress.ai/t/euler-5-testnet/38).

You can follow the syncing process in the terminal. Open a new tab and run the following command:
```bash
docker logs euler-5 --follow
```

Additional information about the chain is available via an API endpoint at: `localhost:26657` (access via your browser)

e.i. the number of active validators is available at: `localhost:26657/validators`

*After your node has successfully synced, you can run a validator.*

##### Prepare the staking address
We included 1 million Ethereum addresses, over 8000 Cosmos addresses and all of `euler-4` validators address into the genesis, so there's a huge chance that you already have some EUL tokens. Here are 3 ways to check this:

If you already have a cyberd address with EUL and know the seed phrase or your private key, just restore it into your local keystore:
```bash
docker exec -ti euler-5 cyberdcli keys add <your_key_name> --recover
docker exec euler-5 cyberdcli keys show <your_key_name>
```

If you have an Ethereum address that had ~0.2Eth or more at block 8080808 (on the ETH network), you can import your Ethereum private key. To do this, please check out our Ethereum [gift tool](qhttps://github.com/cybercongress/launch-kit/tree/0.1.0/ethereum_gift_tool)

> Please do not import high-value Ethereum accounts. This is not safe! cyberd software is new and has not been battle-tested yet.

```bash
docker exec -ti euler-5 cyberdcli keys add import_private <your_key_name>
docker exec euler-5 cyberdcli keys show <your_key_name>
```

If you want to create a new account, use the command below:
(You should send coins to that address to bound them later during the submitting of the validator)

```bash
docker exec -ti euler-5 cyberdcli keys add <your_key_name>
docker exec euler-5 cyberdcli keys show <your_key_name>
```

You could use your ledger device with the Cosmos app installed on it to sign and store cyber addresses: [guide here](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberd/blob/0.1.5/docs/cyberd_Ledger_guide.md).
In common case use the --ledger flag, with your commands:

```bash
docker exec -ti euler-5 cyberdcli keys add <your_key_name> --ledger
```

**<your_key_name>** is any name you pick to represent this key pair.
You have to refer to this parameter <your_key_name> later, when you use the keys to sign transactions.
It will ask you to enter your password twice to encrypt the key.
You will also need to enter your password when you use your key to sign any transaction.

The command returns the address, a public key and a seed phrase, which you can use to
recover your account if you forget your password later.
Keep the seed phrase at a safe place (preferably, not hot storage) in case you have to use it.

The address shown here is your account address. Let’s call this **<your_account_address>**.
It stores your assets.

##### Send the create validator transaction
Validators are actors on the network committing to new blocks by submitting their votes.
This refers to the node itself, not a single person or a single account.
Therefore, the public key here is referring to the nodes public key,
not the public key of the address you have just created.

To get the nodes public key, run the following command:

```bash
docker exec euler-5 cyberd Tendermint show-validator
```

It will return a bech32 public key. Let’s call it **<your_node_pubkey>**.
The next step is to declare a validator candidate.
The validator candidate is the account which stakes the coins.
So the validator candidate is an account this time.
To declare a validator candidate, run the following command adjusting the stake amount and the other fields:

```bash
docker exec -ti euler-5 cyberdcli tx staking create-validator \
  --amount=10000000eul \
  --min-self-delegation "1000000" \
  --pubkey=<your_node_pubkey> \
  --moniker=<your_node_nickname> \
  --trust-node \
  --from=<your_key_name> \
  --commission-rate="0.10" \
  --commission-max-rate="0.20" \
  --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
  --chain-id=euler-5
```

##### Verify that you're validating
```bash
docker exec -ti euler-5 cyberdcli query staking validators --trust-node=true
```

If you see your `<your_node_nickname>` with status `Bonded` and Jailed `false` everything is good.
You are validating the network.

#### A video guide 
We have an awesome video guide that will help you to set-up your infrastructure. It contains additional details and addons for the above guide, make sure to watch it:

[![Validating video guide](https://i.postimg.cc/KjyBtBcz/Screenshot-from-2020-02-18-18-47-25.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMUatLPfNJM&t=1747s)

#### Maintenance of the validator
##### Jailing

If your validator got slashed, it will be jailed.
After such an event, the operator must unjail the validator manually:

```bash
docker exec -ti euler-5 cyberdcli tx slashing unjail --from=<your_key_name> --chain-id euler-5
```

#### CLI guide 
By now you should be familiar working with the validator, any existing command can be executed from the CLI (command-line interface). Here is a list of commands that you can use:

First of all, we would like to encourage you to use the `--help` feature if you want to get a better experience of using cyberdcli. This is a really easy way of finding all the necessary commands with the right options and flags.

  For example, you may enter:
  ```bash
  docker exec euler-5 cyberdcli --help
  ```

  You should see this message:
  ```bash
  Command-line interface for interacting with cyberd

Usage:
  cyberdcli [command]

Available Commands:
  status      Query remote node for status
  config      Create or query an application CLI configuration file
  query       Querying subcommands
  tx          Transactions subcommands

  rest-server Start LCD (light-client daemon), a local REST server

  keys        Add or view local private keys

  version     Print the app version
  link        Create and sign a link tx

  -e, --encoding string   Binary encoding (hex|b64|btc) (default "hex")
  -h, --help              help for cyberdcli
      --home string       directory for config and data (default "/root/.cyberdcli")
  -o, --output string     Output format (text|json) (default "text")
      --trace             print out full stack trace on errors
  ```

The help feature is embedded, you can use it with any command to find any available options, subcommands and flags. For example, lets explore the `query` subcommands:
  ```bash
  docker exec euler-5 cyberdcli query --help
  ```

  You can see the subcommand structure:
  ```bash
  Usage:
  cyberdcli query [command]
  ```

  And the available subcommands and flags:
  ```bash
Available Commands:
  account                  Query account balance

  Tendermint-validator-set Get the full Tendermint validator set at a given height
  block                    Get verified data for a the block at a given height

  rank                     Querying commands for the rank module

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for query

Global Flags:
      --chain-id string   Chain ID of tendermint node
  -e, --encoding string   Binary encoding (hex|b64|btc) (default "hex")
      --home string       directory for config and data (default "/root/.cyberdcli")
  -o, --output string     Output format (text|json) (default "text")
      --trace             print out full stack trace on errors
  ```

Let's explore the `account` subcommand:
  ```bash
  docker exec euler-5 cyberdcli query account --help
  ```

We now see all the options available for this subcommand, namely, account address and flags:
  ```bash
  Usage:
  cyberdcli query account [address] [flags]
  ```

  In most cases you just need 2 extra flags:
  ```bash
  --from=<your_key_name> \
  --chain-id=euler-5
  ```

That's it. It is a very useful ability to be able to use cyberdcli for troubleshooting.

#### Validator launch with Tendermint KMS + Leger Nano
In this guide, you'll find the full information on how to set up your validator at cyberd by using Tenderming KMS and Ledger nano S as a keystore.

##### Preparing your Ledger
We assume you have one. If not, only buy them from trusted sources!

First of all, we'll need to prepare the Ledger to be able to work with Tendermint KMS.
We need to install the Tendermint app onto the Ledger using Ledger Live.

*Note: at the moment, you might need to enable the `developer mode` in Ledger Live settings*

If you have (initially) set up your Ledger on a different machine than the one with cyberd, you should make sure that the Ledger device is recognized by Ledger Live. The best way to do this is by installing [Ledger Live](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/ledger-live) onto that particular machine and attempting to connect the Ledger device to it. This will show any possible issues or/and error codes (if they exist, of course). To deal with them, please use the [Fix connection issues](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005165269-Fix-connection-issues) guide from Ledger.

##### Installing Tendermint KMS onto the node
Normally, this has to be done according to the Tendermint [guide](https://github.com/tendermint/kms), but we will need a few extras (all instructions have been tested on KMS v0.6.3).

##### Installation
You will need the following prerequisites:
- *Rust* (stable; 1.35+) [install](https://rustup.rs/)
- *C compiler*: e.g. gcc, clang
- *pkg-config*
- *libusb* (1.0+) : for Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev`

NOTE (x86_64 only): Configure `RUSTFLAGS` environment variable:
`export RUSTFLAGS=-Ctarget-feature=+aes,+ssse3`  (generally it would be necessary to add these flags to ~/.bash-profile or ~/.profile to make them available after re-login).

We are ready to install KMS. There are 2 ways to do this: compile from source or install with Rusts `cargo-install`. We'll use the first option.

##### Compiling from source code
`tmkms` can be compiled directly from the git repository source code, using the following commands:

``` js
git clone https://github.com/tendermint/kms.git && cd kms
cargo build --release --features=ledgertm,softsign
```

If successful, it will produce the `tmkms` executable located at:
`./target/release/tmkms`.

##### KMS configuration
After compiling, we should create a settings file - `tmkms.toml`, the `secret_connection.key` file and adjust cyberd node settings.

First of all, we need to generate a connection key that will be used for communication with the Ledger device. To do this `cd` to the directory with tmkms executable and run the following (path to save the file is optional):

```py
cd <your_KMS_directory>/target/release/
./tmkms softsign keygen ~/.tmkms/secret_connection.key
```

Once you are done with the connection key, proceed to the config file. It could be created anywhere. It is possible to specify the path to it during tmkms launch.

Here is an example of the `tmkms.toml` config file, working with v0.6.3 of KMS:

```py
[[chain]]
id = "<current_chain_id>"
key_format = { type = "bech32", account_key_prefix = "cyberpub", consensus_key_prefix = "cybervalconspub" }
## Validator configuration
[[validator]]
addr = "tcp://localhost:26658"
chain_id = "<current_chain_id>"
reconnect = true # true is the default
secret_key = "<path_to_secret_connection.key>"
# enable the `ledger` feature
[[providers.ledgertm]]
chain_ids = ["<current_chain_id>"]
```

##### Retrieve the validator key
The last step is to retrieve the validator key that you will be using in cyberd. The Ledger device must be connected, unlocked and has the Tendermint app opened on it.  

Start `tmkms` with the following command:

```c
tmkms start -c ~/.tmkms/tmkms.toml
```

The output should look something like this:

```bash
13:28:35 [info] tmkms 0.6.3 starting up...
13:28:35 [info] [keyring:ledgertm] added consensus key cybervalconspub1zcjduepq8jv0uxx2fw4ur6gj2r3wgs374n6ys5edh9pc4rseqqcaq2yyzy2q0fhx5q
13:28:35 [info] KMS node ID: C0E0DBA8AA82D597E8F893993E66398DDE8F89B0
```

KMS may complain about the impossibility to connect to cyberd. That's fine, we'll fix this in the next section.

The output indicates the validator key that is linked to this particular device:

```bash
cybervalconspub1zcjduepq8jv0uxx2fw4ur6gj2r3wgs374n6ys5edh9pc4rseqqcaq2yyzy2q0fhx5q
```

Take *note* of the validator pubkey that appears on your screen. We will use it in the next section.

##### Configuration of Cyberd
Before we start validating, it's necessary to enable a communication port at `cyberd` itself.  In the config file: `<your_cyberd_location>/cyberd/config/config.toml`, modify the `priv_validator_laddr` value to create a listening address/port. The port should be set according to the `[[validator]] addr =` value of your `tmkms.toml` file.

Example of `config.toml`:

```py
# TCP or UNIX socket address for Tendermint to listen on for
# connections from an external PrivValidator process
priv_validator_laddr = "tcp://127.0.0.1:26658"
```

*NOTE: if you will try to launch cyberd after enabling  `priv_validator_laddr`, and without the `tmkms` app running simultaneously, it will likely NOT start.*

To process further, we assume that `cyberd` node is synced on your machine and there were no validators created previously on that particular node. Also, you should have an imported account to `cyberdcli` that has enough bandwidth and EUL to start validator.

We also assume that the Ledger device is connected, unlocked and has the Tendermint app open.

One last thing: `tmkms` should be launched under a different console session on the same machine.

#### Validator Glossary
**Hero:** A validator node

**Ledger:** A hardware wallet

**Bandwidth:** Used to complete transactions in the cyberd blockchain. The amount of your bandwidth is calculated in the following way:
`your_eul_tokens / all_eul_tokens_in_cyberd * 2000*1000*100`

Messages cost is `500` (excluding linking). Transaction consists of one or more messages `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`. Transaction cost is `300 + c_1 + c_2 ... + c_n`, where `c_i` - cost of `m_i` message. Full bandwidth regeneration time is 86400 blocks (24 hours)

**Commission:**  The tokens that you've earned via validating from delegators. You may take them at any time

**Delegetaors:** Users that have sent (delegated) tokens to your validator node 

**Illiquid tokens:** Non-transferable tokens that you've delegated to the validator. Delegation process duration: 1 block

**Unbonding:** The process of taking back your share (delegated tokens + any rewards).  5 days (for `euler-5` only)

**Link:** A reference between a CID key and a CID value. Link message cost is `100*n`, where `n` is the number of links in a message. Link finalization time is 1 block. New rank for CIDs of links will be recalculated at a period of 100 to 200 blocks (from 100 to 200 seconds)

**Liquid tokens:**  Transferable tokens within the cyber blockchain

**Local keystore:** A store with keys on your local machine

**Rewards** Tokens that you've earned via delegation. To reduce network load all the rewards are stored in a pool. You can take your part of the bounty at any time

**<comission_rate_percentage>** The commission that a validator gets for their work. Must be a fraction >0 and <=1

**<delegator_address>** Delegator address. Starts with `cyber` most often coinciding with **<key_address>**

**<key_address>** An account address. Starts with `cyber`

**<key_name>** The name of an account in cybercli

**<operator_address>** Validator address. Starts with `cybervaloper`

**<shares_percentage>** The part of illiquid tokens that you want to unbond or redelegate. Must be a fraction >0 and <=1

**<testnet_chain_id>** The current version of the testnet (currently `euler-5`).

> You are now off Earth and in orbit. Earth is still seen in the illuminatros. Before we leave our solar system, you decide to improve your knowledge. 

You can't save the galaxy unless you have the right resources for it. This section will teach you about cybernomics, CYB, THC and will touch again on the distribution and its future impact on the project.

### Cybernomics
**Q:** What is cybernomics? <br>
**A:** As explained by [@xhipster](https://github.com/xhipster/cybernomics), Cybernomics is a scientific study of provable control, computing and communication in intelligent beings and amongst them (grammar changed). This means that by cybernomic we can refer to an intellegent communciation economy. Cyber offers such an economic model, where computaion, inicnitives, communciation, utility, bandwidth and third-party storage all come together to shape a useful model. Backed by cybers distribution model, conissitng out of techical games, gifts, inflation, computation and karma. 

The purpose of this section is to examine this model, mention possible futrue plans (depndedt on governance proposal decisions) and describe its value.

### General questions
<details>
  <summary>How many tokens do you have? </summary>
There are currently 2 tokens + Karma
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why do you have 2 tokens? </summary>
Due to technical limitations, there is no way to have all of the described below characteristics in one token. We do not think that having several tokens is a bad thing. In the future, there might be other tokens on top of the DAO or/and the protocol. Of course, if they are proven to help the economics and the agents of that economics.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are the names of your tokens and what does each one do? </summary>
We have 2 tokens. CYB and THC (pronounced as TECH). CYB is the native token of the system and is used for security and bandwidth. THC is used as a governance token in our Ethereum DAO.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is Karma </summary>
You can think of Karma as of your useful reputation. Karma is calculated from your contribution to the knowldge grapph (submitted cyberlinks). Its non-transfarbale and you cannot trade it. However you can, of course, sell your private key with a vertain amoutn of Karma in it. But would you sell your soul?
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How many tokens are there? </summary>
1 PCYB of tokens (and growing). And 700 TTHC.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are MCYB / GCYB / TCYB / PCYB? </summary>
Those are representations of the amounts of CYB tokens in mega, giga, tera, peta, etc. I.E. 1GCYB of tokens is 1 Giga CYB of tokens or 1 with 9 zeros, which equals to 1 billion. 1 GCYB = 1000000000 CYB
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why do you need so many CYB tokens? </summary>
We want to show the world that the digital age contains a lot of numbers. Much more than we can think of. Nature strives towards huge numbers. Grains of sand, neurons, stars in the sky, etc.
On a lower-level, search queries go well beyond billions. This means that we need a lot of tokens to search for a lot of things.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is the CYB token? </summary>
CYB is a native token of cyber powered by the Tendermint consensus algorithm. It has 3 primary uses: (1) staking for consensus, (2) bandwidth limiting for submitting cyberlinks, and (3) expression of will for the computing of cyber~Rank by the agents.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is THC? </summary>
THC is an Ethereum based ERC-20 token that has utility value in the form of control over cyber~ Foundation and the ETH from the distribution games. It is a governance token. The creative powers of THC come from the ability to receive 1 CYB token per each (one) THC token when locking it before the end of cyber~Auction.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is there anything else I can do with the tokens? </summary>
Not in Cyber. I.E. CYB tokens do not have transactional costs. We use bandwidth instead. This means that transactions are free on one hand, but on the other hand, they require you to own at least something to make a transaction and hence, are protected from spam. On the other hand, THC tokens are Ethereum based, so - yes, they have transactional costs withing the Ethereum ecosystem (transactions cost gas).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are Resource Credits (RC)? </summary>
Resource credits are our name for bandwidth amount of an account in the protocol. They are calculated from the liquid stake of an account and allow users to transact. Transactions in the protocol are everything that is done on-chain (on the blockchain). This can be linking, sending tokens, ranking, etc.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are the distribution games? </summary>
The distribution games are a way of improving the distribution of tokens to a higher number of participants in a fairer way through a gamified process.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What do you need them for? </summary>
There are 3 distribution games proposed in total. Their goal is to help increase the initial efficiency of the distribution.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can you explain what are EUL / GOL tokens? </summary>
They are both experimental tokens needed to launch the productive equivalent. EUL is the testing equivalent of CYB and GOL of THC.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is the inflation model endless? </summary>
The inflation in cyberd is defined by validators.
</details>

### The distribution games in detail
We have already mentioned the distribution games briefly. Their purpose is to increase traction and improve distribution. 

There is a total of 3 games, with 2 of them, parts of 1:

- [Game of Links](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/): Is currently happening. Lasts till the end of the first donation round. The main goal of the participants is to win, as many tokens as possible, from cyber~Congress and its seed donators
- Game of Thrones: Will start after the launch of the mainnet and last for 21 days. It is day 0 of the following auction. Its purpose is to battle out 2 communities (ETH and ATOM) for a bigger stake
- cyber~Auction: Will start after GoT is over and accounted for. It is an auction that lasts for a little over 479 days. Its purpose is to fill cyber ~Foundation with money

#### Game of Links or GoL
As mentioned the purpose is to win as many tokens as possible from cyber~Congress and its seed donators. The idea originates with Cosmoses Game of Stakes. This allows to achieve two results simultaneously: test the network, result in a better distribution. PoS is known for not having anything at stake. PoW distributes tokens to those who spend resources and it makes sense. Here, the idea is similar. Use your resources and/or time and acquire tokens via utility. 

There are 7 different disciplines in GoL. Meaning that there are 7 ways to participate in the game. 

The disciplines that depend on the takeoff donations (this means that they are proportional to the sum of donated ATOM, more below):

- The relevance of links submitted (the higher the rank of the content, the better)
- The bandwidth load of every participant (the more you link, the better)
- Life summary of every validator (the longer your uptime is, the better)
- The amount delegated to each validator (the more a validator is delegated, the better)

Independent of takeoff donations (meaning that it does not matter how many ATOM tokens will be donated during takeoff):

- Full validator set (the more validators there are, the better)
- Community pool (experiment and participate in governance)
- euler-4 validator rewards (rewards distributed to validators for the last testnet. Essentially, this means that you cannot participate in this discipline anymore. This is mentioned for transparency)

The results of the Game and the allocation are significantly influenced by the result of the takeoff donations. If 600k ATOM tokens have been donated during the takeoff round, 10% of CYB tokens will be allocated to the Game of Links. The logic is the following: the more has been donated, the more rewards the participants acquire, the less CYB tokens are allocated back to cyber~Congress. 

The development of the project has been done thanks to donations from 10 people. ~ 3200 ETH has been spent during the last 3 years of development. For those donations, at least 4% of CYB tokens are allocated to them via the means of THC tokens from cyber~Congress. To protect the seed donators their share will be defined accordingly to the amount donated during the takeoff round.

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wBBxVsn2/takeoff-allocation.png" />

The above chart describes perfectly the allocation of 5 groups: 

- cyber~Congress (does not include inventors)
- Inventors of rounders of the protocol (2 people)
- Seed donators during the winter round (more below)
- Participators of GoL where allocation depends on takeoff round (disciplines)
- Takeoff donators (those participating in the takeoff round)

We can see that the more ATOM tokens are donated the less cyber~Congress, seed donators and its inventors acquire and the more GoL and takeoff donators get. 

Those are the amounts allocated (up - as some depend on the parametrs above)) to each descipline in CYB tokens: 

- Takeoff donators: Up to 60,000,000,000,000 CYB
- Relevance of links: Up to 15,000,000,000,000 CYB
- Bandwidth load: Up to 6,000,000,000,000 CYB
- Delegations to validators: Up to 5,000,000,000,000 CYB
- Lifetime of validators: Up to 2,000,000,000,000 CYB
- Full validator set: Up to    5,000,000,000,000 CYB (dynamic)
- euler-4 rewards: 5,000,000,000,000 CYB
- Community pool: 2,000,000,000,000 CYB (if used)

To read on about how to participate in GoL, where to obtain initial tokens for it and other information, please view the full post in [our blog](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/).

#### Game of Thrones or GoT
The idea is to see two of the top communities battle it out in return for more tokens. One is ETH and the second is ATOM. We have already gifted both of them proportionally to their size (9% overall). However, the gift can be seen as bootstrap fuel and had a quadratic equation to it to smooth whale accounts. 

The idea of GoT is to see one community of hodlers trying to outbid the other in return for receiving a larger discount. 10% of CYB supply is allocated per each competing community. 100 TCYB to the ATOM community for donating ATOM. And an equivalent amount to the ETH community, which will initially receive THC tokens that they can lock during the auction in exchange for CYB tokens (in other words the ETH donators can potentially receive both THC and CYB tokens). The game will last for 21 days.

To test during the testnet we have allocated 1 TEUL and 1 TGOL to the Cosmos and Ethereum communities, respectively, for testing (please see below on value of test tokens). Test of Thrones is the zero round of the test~Auction. It will last for 10 days. During this period Cosmonauts and Etherians can donate their native tokens. After that EULs and GOLs will be distributed.

The game will be monitored on a special page of cyber.page, where people will be able to follow, donate, etc. There will also be 2 Aragon based applications that will allow users to use both GoT and the auction. 

#### cyber~Auction or auction
The goal of cyber~Auction is to focus on obtaining funds for cyber ~Foundation, the community governed DAO behind the cyber protocol. It will take place after the end of the previous games and last for 500 rounds that last for 23 hours each (a little over 479 days). 

Every round has 1 billion THC is at skate. The more you donate and the less has been donated by others on that same day the more you can gain. After the end of the distribution, participants will be able to unlock their THC tokens and use them as they wish, e.i. transfer, trade, etc. As a result of the auction, the community will have access to all the donated ETH within the Aragon organization.

One more mega important part of the auction to remember, are the creative powers of THC. If you vest your THC tokens for the period of the auction, you will receive 1 CYB token for each locked THC token for the duration of the auction!

6 TGOL have been allocated for the test~Auction. There will be a mock period of 60 days, during which community can donate in ETH and claim GOL tokens on a daily basis.  

### Understanding what goes where
The economics of cyber can be confusing at first sight. It isn't. Let's try to go over what pot goes where, why and to whom.

There are 4 parts that we can break in cybernomics to understand it easier:

- The donation rounds
- The distribution games
- The gift
- The tokens and their utility

#### Donation rounds
We can summarize that there are 4 rounds. Their purpose is to charge 2 DAOs with pots of funds so that they can develop the protocol. 

- Self-funding: The project has been self-funded over a few years with a sum closing to ~3200 ETH summed up with the winter round (not including 2020)
- Public winter round for friends: Was a public seed donator round. Information [is here](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/26a33ce5ed92204f67c79dd8036690019bcf3f89/friends/winter.md). Sumed up with self-funding, the total donated sum was ~3200 ETH (not including 2020)
- Takeoff round: The takeoff donation round is a round where up to 600k ATOM is donated to the cyber~Congress DAO via distribution games (more below). This sum is used by the DAO to support its initial ideas and the protocol via reaching [a sustainable flow of income](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues/302), including things like ATOM staking, etc
- Auction round: Is broken into 2 parts, a 21 day round and equal rounds for 479 days. During the first 21 days, ETH and ATOM are donated to the cyber~Congress DAO via the use of the auction. For the larger period of the auction. I.E. 479 days, ETH is donated to the cyber ~Foundation DAO, which is a community governed DAO, via auction proceeds in exchange for THC (governance tokens). During the second part of the auction, THC tokens can be vested and locked to later, receive CYB tokens on 1-1 basis for each locked THC token for the period of the auction 

In the end, there will be 2 separate entities (both are Aragon DAOs). The main governing entity: cyber~Foundation in charge of the ETH donated during the auction. And cyber ~Congress, the launching DAO that will carry on working on the protocol, in accordance to the governance proposals made by cyber ~Foundation and will remain as one of the entities that commits to the protocol over its remaining lifetime.

#### The distribution games
There are 3 distribution games, described above. Their purpose is to achieve the best possible distribution, gain initial traction and test all of the network's possibilities. 

- Game of Links: includes in itself the takeoff donation round. Started with euler-5 and will finish when the takeoff donation round is over. Its purpose is to distribute tokens from cyber~Congress to the participants. Aimed at initial believers of the protocol
- Game of Thrones: Can be thought of as the final part of GoL or window 0 of the auction. A 21-day game in which ETH and ATOM communities battle it out for the biggest pot. Aimed at speculators
- cyber~Auction: a 479-day long auction, which charges cyber ~Foundation with ETH. THC can be vested for CYB. Aimed at everyone in the community

#### The gift
cyber has dropped 10% of its supply to 3 communities:

- ETH: 8%, being the biggest dev community in the field 
- ATOM: 1%, being the engine that backs cyber and the biggest growing community of devs
- URBIT: 1%, being the most technologically advanced community in the field

The purpose of the gift is to get initial traction, attract the best communities, test interest, achieve a better distribution. There were over 1 million addresses that were eligible to receive the gift (more below).

#### The tokens and their utility
Meaning that there are 2 utility tokens in the economy (+1 bonus points token):

- CYB: The main token. Needed to create cyberlinks, transact, build the knowledge graph, etc
- THC: The governance token. Needed to make proposals. Can be locked for the auction and swapped at 1-1 basis
- Karma: Karma points aren't really a token. They are a calculation and a representation of the submission a person made to the knowledge graph. It cannot be swapped, bought, etc

This leaves us with a clearer picture of which funds and donations go where. The whole distribution can be viewed in the [launch kit repo](https://github.com/cybercongress/launch-kit/blob/0.1.0/distribution/README.md).

### CYB and THC

- tokens and utility
- transactions

### EUL and GOL

Please note, that all of the games will be tested during the testnets with EUL and GOL tokens, which are the equivelant of CYB and THC in the mainnet. The EUL tokens have little value (in regards to price value). Their main purpose is to serve as the basis for reward calculation during the Game of Links. The GOL tokens also have no significant value in terms of price. They will allow gaining EUL tokens during the game - if vested. Non-vested GOL tokens do not have any value at all. GOL tokens serve (1) as a means to provide incentivized testing of Ethereum contracts, and (2) as a spam protection mechanism for the faucet. DO NOT spend a significant amount of funds buying GOL during Test of Thrones & test~Auction and/or EUL over the counter. GOL tokens will be burned after the euler-5 testnet is over. All accounts in the euler experimental networks series will be reseted. All ETH and ATOM sent to the faucet during the Game of Links are donated to cyber ~Congress. 

| During euler-5 testnet |	During cyber mainnet |
|----------|------|
| Test of Thrones  | 	Game of Thrones | 
| test~Auction  | 	cyber~Auction | 
| GOL token  | 	THC token | 
| EUL token  | 	CYB token | 
| Takeoff donations  | 	Not applicable | 

### Gift
Cyber has gifted 3 communities as per the commitment to do so in our [White Paper](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmceNpj6HfS81PcCaQXrFMQf7LR5FTLkdG9sbSRNy3UXoZ).

Those are the Ethereum (8%), Cosmos (1%) and Urbit (1%) communities. 

The purpose of those gifts is to help the network gain traction in the beginning and to increase the initial participation. 
This will help to increase cooperation and give more participants the ability to engage in the protocol. 
We chose these specific communities because they are the best communities, in our opinion, to help to form the knowledge graph and to reach the masses.

As a result, Cyber will gain a massive benefit via the economic integration of the largest developers, the most innovative and of the most promising communities withing the open-source space. Similary, those communities will gain traction from joining forces with Cyber - the builder of the Great Web!

<details>
  <summary>What token did you gift? </summary>
We have gifted CYB, the main ecosystem utility token needed to use the protocol.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How much did you gift? </summary>
We have gifted 10% of the total supply, broken down as per the following: Ethereum: 8%, Cosmos: 1%, Urbit: 1%.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Who received the gift? </summary>
ETH hodlers with at least 1 outgoing transaction (non-contract addresses only). And a balance bigger than 0.2 ETH at block 8080808.
ATOM hodlers within Cosmos hub-2 at block 1110000 which held any balance bigger than 0.
URBIT aliens that had planets, stars or galaxies on the 18.12.2019 (with at least one outgoint tx on the corresponding ETH address).

Please note that ATOM and ETH gifts were distributed proportionally to the square root of each account balance during the snapshots.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How many addresses received gifts? </summary>
Ethereum: 998015 addresses. Cosmos: 10715. Urbit: 884.
</details>

<details>
  <summary> Was anyone else gifted?</summary>
Not exactly. However, there were 76 validator addresses in Euler-4 (one of our public testnets) that received tokens for their work.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I check the balance of my gift? </summary>
There are at least 3 ways to do so:
The easiest and the quickest: go to cyber.page and just enter your ETH or ATOM address in the search bar. This will result in a EUL (testnet token) balance if you met the requirements for the gift.
You may connect your ledger device on cyber.page to check out the ATOM gift balance. Simply connect your ledger and follow the steps.
You may use gift tools from the launch-kit to check your gift balance (this requires some technical skills)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I check my balance if my tokens are on a Ledger? </summary>
Simply export your ETH / ATOM account address and use one of the options above
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I claim my gift? </summary>
You do not need to. If you were lucky enough to receive a gift, they are yours already! Cyber addresses can be generated from a Cosmos seed or an ETH private key. This means that if you received a gift, just create an address and it will already have a balance!
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How to create a cyber address? </summary>
One way is to use your Ledger with cyber.page (for ATOM only).
The other one is to install cyberdCLI and create an address (this requires technical skills.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Will the gift burn if I don't take it now? </summary>
Simply put - no. You don't need to worry about this as long as cyber is alive and you have the keys to claim the gift.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>So, I've received a gift. What can I do with it now? </summary>
Start playing The Game! By playing you can receive more tokens! The Game of Links is a game with a lot of technical disciplines and incentives. The main goal of the participants is to win, as many tokens as possible, from cyber~Congress and its seed donators.


If you have your tokens on a Ledger account from an ATOM gift, simply go on cyber.page, follow the instructions closely and start linking!

Other ways to participate in the game is to install cyberdcli and add your ledger account as a cold wallet with the --ledger flag.

In all other cases, look for your Cosmos seed or ETH private key, install cyberdcli and play from the CLI. Of course, you may also set-up a validator node and participate in the other disciplines. Find more information in this blog post.
</details>

<details>
  <summary> What else can I do with the tokens?</summary>
HODL...
</details>

  <summary>But I want CYB, and I received EUL. What's going on? </summary>
EUL is the testnet name of CYB. When the mainnet launches, all EUL tokens will be converted to CYB tokens.

FYI GOL is the test name for THC (the governance token).

Important Euler-5 is a testnet with a different total supply to the cyber mainnet. The supply in the mainnet is larger, hence due to change of supply and due to the results of the Game of Links, balances may and will change. Of course, proportions to total supply are kept between the networks.

  <summary>How do I know my ETH / ATOM / URBIT keys are safe? </summary>
Your keys are stored locally with you. We do not ask for your keys. If you did not enter them anywhere, we do not know them. Please refrain from entering your seed / private key anywhere. This is not safe!


It is a good practice to transfer any balance you have out of an address after you have claimed a gift. I.E. if I claimed a git using my ETH address and had a balance on that address. It might be a good idea to move that balance out to a new address for extra security.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why do I need to take the gift? </summary>
First of all - you are not obliged to anything. But if you understand the purpose of cyber, then the more tokens you will have, the more options open up to you in regards to search, building the knowledge graph and creating the new Great Web. Cyber is a decentralized google, for provable and relevant answers that you can be a part of.

### cyber~Congress's + seed investors pot
The pot that cyber~Congress accounts for is dependent on dynamic parameters. It can be broken into 2 categories:

- Any self-funded funds from team members and/or inventors
- Donated ATOMs during seed, takeoff, etc donation rounds

- Up to 6% of CYB tokens to the DAO, dependent on the donated ATOMs during takeoff round (the more donated, the smaller the pot)
- Up to 3% of CYB tokens to the inventors, dependent on the donated ATOMs during takeoff round (the more donated, the smaller the pot)

The pot of seed investors is also dynamic. It depends on the donations during takeoff round and can be up to 6% of CYB tokens.

**Vital** cyber~Congress and seed investors are NOT the same entitt, however some people might overcross. We are publishing these numbers, solely, for transparency!

In other words, up to 97 TTHC (the governance token) is allocated to inventors, team members, including [possible incentives](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/teams/incentives.md) and to seed donators. 

Those THC tokens can (and most likely will) be vested for the period of cyber~Acution to receive an equal amount of CYB tokens. This means that cyber~Congress might posses between 9-10% (including incentives) of CYB and THC tokens. This does not include any personal pots acquired by inventors or DAO members, as this is virtually impossible to account for unless the DAO members will disclose this information.

From those funds, a certain portion will be allocated towards the creation of [cyber~FundClassic](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/ELI-5%20FAQ.md#who-are-cyberfundclassic), which will be a for-profit DAO responsible for finding teams that develop cyber and fund them with initial bags.  

Apart from this, cyber~Congress will also hold a certain amount of ATOMs donated during the takeoff donation round and some ATOMs that will be donated during GoT. 

### Possible future amendments
In the future, cyber~Congress or any other user might propose amendments to the economy via governance proposals. It will be up to the governance to decide whether or not these amendments will take place. 

### Where is the money Lebowski?
We can break the understanding of this into 3 categories. Before we do that. It is vital to understand that the real value of computers and protocols comes from utility, development and adoption on a later stage. We see 4 groups that have various interests in the protocol:

- cyber~Congress: it is up to cyber ~Congress to reach a sustainable flow of income and to obtain funding from governance proposals as either the or one of the developing teams
- Evangelists: the ambassadors of cyber. As we see it, they possess both, a speculative interest and in sharing the idea of changing the world. Their value comes mainly from building a social knowledge graph, referring donators, participating in games, etc
- Heroes: the validators of cyber. Possibly large donators, but primarily infrastructure providers. Earn from supplying infrastructure and inflation
- Masters: the users of cyber. The largest group. They can have an income from inflation via delegating to heroes. They can also take part in shaping up web3, providing services, marketing, advertising, selling goods, creating markets, etc, in the new Great Web

### Questions

<details>
  <summary>Why open-source? </summary>
Because open-source technology is the future way of communication between projects, users and developers. Open-source doesn't stop at referencing to technological progress. Open-source is a new way to collaborate. It allows people to freely change, commit to and modify ideas. And as a result, help progress and innovation at a higher temp and in a more secure manner.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Are you Satoshi? </summary>
We wish... And we don't. We wish we were so smart and to have the knowledge of whomever Satoshi was/were/ is/are... We do not wish because knowing who Satoshi is, would destroy the whole idea of Satoshi.
</details>

<details>
  <summary> Why are you so geeky?</summary>
Why not? Geeky is the new cool. Geeks are awesome. If you didn't notice the world has been ruled by Geeks since the Microsoft made it to the top. In the last century, geeks have been all around us. From Facebook to google.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>I read one of your manifests, are you crazy? </summary>
I would lie if I said we weren't. But doesn't it take a bit of craziness, abstract geniuses and adventurism to change the world? Knowledge is a vital virtue that we possess. But if we were normal, we wouldn't be any different from the rest.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why do you talk so much about values? </summary>
Because values are what spins the world around. Our values lay at the core of the technology that we have created. Those values are the driver of that innovation. They are the goal. The technology is the instrument to get there.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why all species? </summary>
Because all species should (and will) have an equal opportunity for secure and transparent communication.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How can all species be intelligent? </summary>
Intelligence can be simplified to communication. All species can communicate via electromagnetic impulses (including robots). If they can communicate (which they can), they can prove their existence and pass on a signal and receive an answer. This is intelligence at its most pure form.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why do you need all those manifests/researches? How does it help the project? </summary>
We think that it is stupid to achieve any goals without understanding the problem you are trying to solve. Daily, all around the world, people do something... But why do just something, when you can do THE something that needs to be done and that solves the problem you or someone else were trying to solve? We believe that all of this can, and will, help the project as it evolves trust in what we do. Shows that we have an understanding of what and why we do it. And that we are ready to prove the world that it will help to fix broken protocols for the better.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How is this AI related? </summary>
First, what is AI? AI is the intelligence demonstrated by a machine. This doesn't necessarily mean that the machine must be from the year 12255 (by then, it will probably be a world of machines as it is).

In its essence cyber is a huge distributed consensus computer, it is a dynamic protocol that is influenced by different machines and users simultaneously. It learns from actions. It can prune things that are irrelevant to it. It can prove the relevance of any two existing objects that are known to it.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do you plan to take over the world/internet? </summary>
By showcasing and awesome product and with the help of the community behind it. Of course, those are loud words. But our product is working. The idea has proved to be functioning and has a proved and a cemented market demand. We are experimenting, but we are an experienced team. We have the knowledge, the understanding and the passion to drive this product forward. In combination with the product itself, the code, the community, the donations, the DAO, and everything else - it will either happen (the taking over)... or it won't. Either way, we will do everything to make this happen!
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is this religious? </summary>
Yes. By all means, it is. It is the most anti-religious techno-religion in the wild.
</details>

<details>
  <summary> What is your main target audience?</summary>
Our main TA are internet users. We plan to concentrate on developers, IPFS users, crypto maniacs and like-minded people at the beginning. We then, want to concentrate on younger generations. We firmly believe that they can grasp what we do (including our values) better than anyone else.
</details>

### The evolution of species
> The cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff. We are a way for the universe to know itself
Carl Sagan

The making of cyber has a lot put behind it. I could Theoretically go straight to the point (and if you are eager to know more, simply skip to the next section), but I think it is vital to state that values are what keeps the world spinning around (or rather what keeps it from spinning around the wrong way).

We do not believe in captchas. We do not believe in KYC. We do not believe in licensing and any other similar to the above-mentioned bullshit. We do believe in code. We believe in innovation and in making use of our knowledge to make the world a slightly better place for our children.

With that in mind, what I'm trying to say, is that cyber and cyb are not just technological results. They are much more. At its base lay the values of the team behind cyber. We hope that our project can re-create certain values of what we believe the blockchain paradigm stands for. 

Some of these ideas might seem crazy to you. Some you might completely disagree with. And that's good. We don't expect anyone to fully agree with what we do. Please remember that the ideas outlined below belong to cyber~Congress, cyber is a separate entity governed by cyber ~foundation. However, as a DAO those ideas drive us forward and we feel that it is necessary to share them with the public for transparency. 

#### The manifest
The most difficult thing about a freedom manifest is making it not as a manifest. This was rightly pointed out by @sparky. As the work with manifests and everything related to it is not as vital as launching cyber, we do not, currently, spend much time on it. However you may find the occasional pull request in that direction and if you are willing to help, [feel free to do so](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/pulls).

Our Mission is to help the evolution of species!

Over 40 years ago, Earth launched Voyager 1 and 2 into deep space. Until today, this mission [is ongoing](https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status/) and keeps uniting us as species and gives all of us hope. With the Voyagers, our species sent the [golden record](https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/golden-record/whats-on-the-record/) to space, assembled out of 115 images and a variety of natural sounds, such as those made by surf, wind and thunder, birds, whales, and other animals. To this, they added musical selections from different cultures and eras and spoken greetings from Earth-people in fifty-five languages.

That record carries what we believe in, with this, below, we have outlined the goals and values that we believe in the most. This is a hard mission, as our foremost wish is freedom and outlining anything when speaking of freedom is hard.

Blockchain technology has opened the opportunity for development which was previously impossible.

The great John Lenon once said:
`Imagine there's no countries`
`Nothing to kill or die for`
`And no religion, too`
`You may say I'm a dreamer`
`I hope someday you'll join us`
`And the world will be as one`

Those words are not kept to their original order, but they still carry the same message that we share.

We have goals and values. Most of our goals we recreate into general issues on our roadmap. from there, you may follow any of these and see how they break down into tasks and overgo an evolution until there is a result. 

Most of our goals and values overlap. Some of them can be expresses as a reference to movies, songs, poetry, academic research. Some are easier listed:

- Security: We do not work with fiat and avoid bureaucratic paper hassle. We prefer to work with digital signatures
- Anonymity and privacy: If someone chooses to stay anonymous or private, it is their right to do so. We respect it
- Open-source software: Everything we release into production should be open-source and auditable
- Open-source hardware: Every piece of hardware that goes into production, should be open-sourced and auditable
- Transparency: We believe that transactional transparency is fundamental to building decentralized communities
- Informational freedom: Local laws should not prohibit data flow and information
- Economic freedom: Nobody should prevent or block public transactions
- Free will: We reject corporate slavery bullshit, such as conflict of interest or NDA
- Capital, not salary: Helping to switch from dragging to the bottom salary to a capital-based, passive income for species 
- Engineering is marketing: We would rather spend our resources on engineering than on marketing
- Physical liberty: Limitations to physical liberty can be economic, but not authoritative
- Automation: Everything that can be automated, should be automated
- Intelligence: An entity can be treated as intelligent if they can provably communicate
- Decentralization: Everything that can be decentralized, shall be decentralized
- Always on the edge: We try to offer alternatives to outdated technologies such as emails

By sharing those values we want to show what drives us. What makes our inner clocks tick. Those values unite us. If you check out the project `roadmap`, you will find a list of episodes, ranging from I - V. These [episodes](https://github.com/orgs/cybercongress/projects/2), as already mentioned, include our goals. 

They can be grouped into the following categories:

- Science: building a strong scientific foundation, space exploration, technologies that can transfer human conciseness, extend living capabilities, improve ecology (thermoregulation) 
- Development: improving consensus computers, developing interfaces, integrating post-quantum cryptography, independent robots, open tools for biological engineering, develop metaverse    
- Economy: achieving an incentivized system for all types of actors, self-sustainability, access to equal economics to all species, creating incentives for AI
- Transparency: providing access to transactions, lack of censorship, demolishing borders and states
- Privacy: a possibility for private communication
- Governance: finding replacements for control, open unified registries
- Social: abolishing fear, freedom of choice, bringing sociology and anthropology back to natural ways

Below is one of the most important quotes ever said on Earth by Carl Sagan:

“Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.” ― Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space

We share this vision, but we look forward and even beyond it.

We understand that technicalities are boring, but we want to be transparent. To achieve our goals we will utilize any type of appropriate to our values technology that either exists or create it ourselves. 

May the code be with you. Don't believe. Don't fear. Don't ask!

#### R&D
We prefer a scientific approach to guessing. Hence R&D makes for a large part of our values and goals as a DAO. Currently, there aren't many public research cases that we have published. Our fields of research include:

- Cybernomics (economy and crypto): 
  - [cyber](https://github.com/cybercongress/go-cyber). Status: Working. Bounties
  - [Research library by @hipster](https://github.com/xhipster/cybernomics). Status: Ongoing.
- Hardware: 
  - [cyber~Labs](https://github.com/cyblabs). Status: Open
- Communications of interspecies: 
  - [Deep Bidirectional Transformers](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/research/knowledge%20graph/Deep%20Bidirectional%20Transformers%20(working%20name).md). Status: Open. Bounty 

All our research is done by using open-source instruments. We only start research if we understand the architecture of the solution and can implement it into a working product. Most of our research is sponsored via bounties. 

We will continue to do research and publish and implement results into working products, hoping for the help and support of cyber~Foundation for future funding, ideas and implementations. 

### Usecases
There are many ways to describe cyber. In its simplest form, it is a computer for answers. But that leaves a lot of ambiguity as to what this can be used for. 

It is quite difficult to break these by topis as they are all interconnected. Hence, for now, I am not sure how to separate them for easier reading. 

Also, please remember that the below cases are true as of today - partially. Some of them contain my imagination, that requires certain technological implementations.

*Web3 browsers*:
We have [already built one - Cyb](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb). What should be understood, as that Cyb is a personal search application with an inbuilt search engine and another ton of features (like personal robots, the ability to transact, etc). It is your personal app on top of an objective database of knowledge, without any custodial restrictions or any adverts (unless you want to implement them for yourself). What's more important, is that it lacks web2 bullshit. And... you can make your own browser/s on top of Cyber if you have the skills (you can also customize Cyb).

*Personal robots*:
When you start up Cyb, the protocol creates a robot tied to your private key. He is your personal demiurge. He studies with you, helps you, guides you. But he is much more. And he does not have to be alone. In theory, such robots can be taught anything you want them to know. For example: he can be taught semantics related to your trading over the years, follow your trades, study the related papers that you read. This will create a unique trading robot, just yours and only yours. Just imagine what else can a robot be used for if it has access to your knowledge. In theory, with the help of second layer semantics, we can teach robots emotions. I.E. - this cyberlink makes me sad. That cyberlink makes me happy, etc. This allows a robot to give you the content that you want. It allows him to share it, if you want, with others, it allows him to study you - creating things that are way beyond imagination right now. 

*Personal assistant*:
It is not simply a robot, it is an assistant that with the help of certain instruments can help you to evolve, predict your behaviour (let's assume that you allow it to study DNA) and help to teach children, help them to evolve, etc. This is not "I know kong-fu" in 2 seconds, but its the right path in that direction.

*Database access*:
Cyber gives you the ability to access your database of knowledge. Theoretically, create a personal knowledge graph and query it. This means no more losing information. Less time to study a subject. And so on.

*Basic income*:
Such a robot can help to solve 2 problems (a) personal data reselling - if you want to sell it, you decide to do so. (b) the above is just one example of how to produce basic income. In theory personal data, trading robots, content robots, oracle mechanism - they all can provide a human with a basic passive income. This solves a world-renowned issue!

*Gamification*:
There are plenty of examples of how this can be introduced and used. One is, of course, an application that allows personal robots to battle one another and earn rewards. 

*Education*:
Cyber can easily become the main, unbiased and uncontrolled resource for **relevant** information. This is important. Information is dynamic. It evolves. Meaning that a person will have access to relevant information without any intermediary opinions. 

*Programmable (or natural) semantics*:
With the help of Cyber, you can structure search results and target specific semantics cores and index apps as you wish if you were a programmer. If you are a user though, Cyber gives us the ability to literally, re-create the semantics of the web. We communicate with the help of semantics, hence, such communications have been evolving unnaturally due to restrictions and limitations from search engines. considering that search engines contain all that we know as humans, then this is not ok. Cyber lets users and engineers fix this. 

*Create a complicated matrix*:
Google is a genius instrument. Google has all the people on earth working for free and creating a semantically structured centralised database. One of the major issues is that Google does this without using the resources at your disposal (let alone the centralised database and working for free). This means that the semantic matrix that we can create has a restriction. By using all the resources in your possession we can create complicated semantical matrixes around us, helping us to study, evolve and understand things.

*Earn reards*:
As simple as this sounds. It is. Simply cyberlink what is important to you and earn rewards by staking. 

*Intercommunication knowledge graphs*:
All species on earth can have a separate knowledge graph. Any species can intake and output an electromagnetic impulse - hence communicate, therefore - it is intelligent. Meaning that we might not be able to talk directly about our day with other species. But, all species can understand basic behaviour mechanisms - survival, breed, fighting, etc. This means that if each species will have an own knowledge graph, then with the help of second layer semantics and some basic ML algorithms we can create inter-species communications...

*Search actions*: 
It is important to have applications that can transact and can prove those transactions. Cyber allows for several crypto-related powers to emerge. Such as: with the help of wrappers, be able to view balances, send transactions, sign messages, etc. Basically, manage your portfolio if you have the right tools in place. With the help of basic algorithms, the ability to search and analyze blockchains and tangles will allow for many possibilities to study protocols, study behaviour, transactions, and so on. This can help protocols to study and understand computation, resources wastage, bandwidth problems and so on. In theory, Cyber can allow for cross-chain, semantically-backed transactions sometime in the future. This idea is mind-blowing. 

*Off-line search*: 
IPFS makes it possible to easily retrieve a document from such an environment without a global internet connection. cyberd itself can be distributed by using IPFS. This creates the possibility for ubiquitous, off-line search! 

*Command tools*: 
Command-line tools can rely on relevant and structured answers from a search engine. Searching from within CLI tools will inevitably create a highly competitive market of a dedicated semantic core for robots.

*Autonomous robots*: 
Cyber offers a minimalistic, but a continuously self-improving data source, which provides the necessary tools for programming economically rational robots. With the help of IoT integrations and basic networking tools, we can create robots that make decisions based upon a well studied and structured semantic database (knowledge graph).

*Language convergence*: 
A dream of a truly global language is hard to deploy because it is hard to agree on what means what. However, we have the tools to make this dream come true. A programmer should not care about what language will an agent be using. The entire UTF-8 spectrum is at work. The semantic core is open, so competition for answering queries can become distributed across different domain-specific areas, including the semantic cores for various languages. 

*Self prediction and risk management*:
Cyber can analyze its state based on a huge internal knowledge database that is constantly evolving. What's more interesting is that a consensus computer can continuously build a knowledge graph on its own, predicting the existence of cyberlinks and applying these predictions to its state. This means that we can create rather crazy things, for example: risk management instruments, war predictions, economic failure or success predictions, etc. 

*Universal oracle*: 
A consensus computer can store the most relevant data in a key-value storage, where the key is a CID and the values are the bytes of the actual content. To compute utility measure, validators check the availability and the size of the content for the top-ranked content addresses within the knowledge graph, then, weight on the size of the CIDs and its rank. Values could be used in programs. If we try to imagine what this can lead to, then we can come up with the unimaginable. One such example can be a local or a universal program that can be used to reach local consensus for something that could not have been reached before. This is based on the fact that the analysis happens on data, that is based on the true will of the agents. 

*Universal emotional mechanism*:
In theory, combined with your personal robot that has been semantically thought emotions, we have the option to speak to our mind. We can analyze all the data that we been studying for years and query it. For example, an agent was linking for many years, something with the emotion of happiness. By such, this agent can query all the happiness results and then a local community can follow and do the same (each one for himself). Thereafter a local (or on a larger scale) community can choose to share those results between each other and analyze what can be implemented as a suited, organic and a natural happiness mechanism for this particular community, etc.

*Proof of location*:
It is possible to construct cyberlinks with 'proof-of-location', consequently, a location-based search can also become provable, if web3-agents will mine triangulations and attach ‘proof of location’ for every linked chain. Apart from the obvious, this can create digital registers, digital land tokens and even digital countries within geo-space. 

*Proof of web3-agent*: 
Content can be tied with an agent via a private key if that content is on the knowledge graph. This can help to create meaningful air-drops and help for wealth distribution via the use of provable links.

*Natural anthropology*:
If Cyber grows, then it will be easy to connect with like-minded people and build communities with them. With the help of semantics and the knowledge graph, it will be enough, to just press "find people like me" button, and without giving away any information - it will.

*Amazing social networks*:
To continue the above thought, if a person does not want to connect physically, just imagine the on-line possibilities this can create. This will allow for naturally created social networks, with like-minded people, based on knowledge, interests and so on. A network where you talk to people that you want. Maybe in VR. Maybe on a digital piece of land. Without revealing who you are, if you don't want to. Peers will still be able to prove relevance to one another! 

*Motivation for read requests*:
It would be great to create cybernomics not only for ‘write’ requests to consensus computers but from ‘read’ requests too. Thus, read requests can become orders of magnitude cheaper but still guaranteed. Read requests to a search engine can be provided by the second tier of nodes which earn CYB tokens within state channels. We consider implementing state channels based on HTLC and proof of verification, which unlocks the number of tokens earned for already served requests.

*Prediction markets on link relevance and beyond*:
An application that allows betting on link relevance can become a unique source of truth for the direction of terms. This can create a whole new prediction market. And not only for links but for anything semantically related. Why prediction markets? Because they are (currently) the perfect example of a peer to peer transactional behaviour, meaning that a variety of such markets can help local economies to evolve.

*File-hosting*
File hosting is a huge market. Memory, in terms of disk space, is something we all possess. Several projects in the space are working on solving the issue. We believe that a ranking mechanism can improve search over disk space by a mile. For example, it can introduce more security in terms of seeing which content is ranked higher and which nodes are more trustworthy. Along with our other ideas, like Karma points (for linking) and Urbit integration into the project, it is safe to say that cyber can become a major player on the file-hosting market. 

### Subculture
Cyber has and is building its own subculture. We believe that the idea of gamification and a sense of belonging are 2 vital parts of success for a product. 

In the glossary of the colonization section, you will find terms with their description. 

We will continue to build upon the subculture, utilizing not just naming like heroes, masters, etc. But, connect these ideas to implementations. For example karma points, which are a simple way of measuring the contributions to a knowledge graph via introducing a reputation system. 

In the future, we plan on implementing NFTs, robot wars, levels and other gamication elements.

4) Click on the pencil icon next to the `History` button! This will take you to the edit page.
