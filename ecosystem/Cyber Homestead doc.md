## Section subtitle: Landing completed
**Congratulations!** You are now a cyber~Cosmonaut and a have all the tools that you need to build the `Great Web`! We salute you for completing this journey. Help us to improve by learning how to submit a PR and find more links that will help you to survive out in the wild.

#### Improving this document
We welcome and eagerly await new builders to help us prepare our spaceships for take-off. Its never been as easy, just do it - [sumbit a pull request with an improvement!](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/pulls)
A pull request is essentially a way to contribute to any open-source project on GitHub. Whilst we are not planning to teach you how to use GitHub, we strongly advise you to learn how to use both git and GitHub. It is fairly easy and simple and will be a great tool for you to add to your skills. Check out [this free guide](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners). Please note, that to submit a PR, you don't need to read over it, it's even simpler than you might think. 

1) Open your favourite, web2, browser, navigate to [github.com](https://github.com/), fill in the info and hit the `Sign up` button in the top right corner:

2) After you verify your email, fill in user details, look around to get more acquainted, its time to find [our GitHub page](https://github.com/cybercongress). Either follow the link above or navigate to the page manually, using the search:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/CK7s0DQ8/Screenshot-from-2020-02-06-14-30-03.png" />

On the page find the [congress repositry](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress) (*hint*: it might not be located where you see it on the picture above): 

3) From there navigate to the `ecosystem` folder and find the [cyber Homestead doc](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md).

4) Click on the pencil icon next to the `History` button! This will take you to the edit page. Here you may edit the document with what you think needs to be added (this might be another guide, a new picture, diagram, etc). Do not be scared of messing it up, the changes will NOT be automatically added to the doc on our GitHub. Let's change the title:

5) Hit `Preview changes` to see how it looks (you may scroll down, of course, if needed) (*hint*: any new or removed change will have a colour to the left of it): 

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/CKbb6BW3/Screenshot-from-2020-02-06-14-32-26.png" />

6) After you made sure that you added what you wanted and it looks like you want it to look, scroll to the bottom of the page and find the `Commit changes` box. Add a description of your changes, make sure you are on a new branch and hit the green `Propose file change`
