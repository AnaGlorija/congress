The guide is, currently, made by the [cyber~Congress team](https://cybercongress.ai/). Its meant to be a knowledge database for everything that there is to know about the beast cyber is. 

If you have any suggestions or want to help to make this guide, simply [sumbit a GitHub issue](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues).

## :fuelpump: Section subtitle: Ground floor
Comsonouts do not become who they are if the initail training isn't done properly. In this section, you will find out about some basic terminology that you will need to understnad cyber, and dive right into some of the its basics. Including the history of cyber, how it works, how to use it and our philosophy.

### Technical questions in plain terms
**Click on the below questions to expand the answers!**
<details>
  <summary> What are distributed technologies? </summary>
Distributed technologies are technologies that do not have a central source of power in terms of computing and storage. In terms of blockchains (distributed data ledgers), it is primarily referred to databases that are shared across multiple independent sources and have an agreement on the shared information at any point in time in those databases (are in consensus).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a consensus computer?</summary>
A consensus in computing refers to the process of different computers agreeing on some data and/or its value. For example, they might need to agree on the current time or whether or not Alice has 10 BTC (Bitcoins) on her account balance. So, a consensus computer is a computer that is involved in that process (usually used specifically and solely for that purpose).
  </details>
  
<details>
  <summary> What's a hash? </summary>
A hash means a reworking of old and familiar material. In computing, this refers to a bunch of symbols that represent a particular piece of information/data/file (more precisely, it authenticates the fact that the data represented is what it is). In other words, it is a `fingerprint`. 
I.E a sha256 hash of `cyber` is: `99100ac04db2147ef246377b1ea4fc0c17106d37286e5d61cc02201301a85bbb`. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary> What is a Merkle tree?</summary>
A Merkle tree is the name of a representation (an analogy if you may) of how some data (information) is structured (into a database). It is shaped like a tree, where there is one major root, from which others spawn and they are related to it. From those more branches/roots spawn out, until we get to the leaves, which represent the current upper level of the information. All the information can be traced from any point to any other point and is mathematically tied one to another.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a blockchain? </summary>
A blockchain is a distributed ledger into which independent participants write, and read from it - information. It is protected by the fact that it is distributed across participants computers, which are in agreement one with another at any point of a given time (past or present). A blockchain is auditable to anyone and transparent. This allows its participants to make sure that there is nothing shady happening in the background. Usually, data in blockchains is structured with the help of a Merkle tree or a Directed Acyclic Graph (more commonly knows as a DAG, which in very basic terms, is just a different way of structuring data). 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a transaction? </summary>
In terms of a blockchain, a transaction is the process of moving data. I.E. I have 10 dollars and pass them to your account. I made a transaction.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's a token? </summary>
A token in blockchain terms is a digital representation of some certain value, relating to a specific distributed ledger. It should contain some utility i.e. it should be used to do something, which in turn gives it value for the participants (users) of that ledger. It can be represented in several ways and there can be more than one token on one ledger. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is NFT? </summary>
NFT are non-fungible tokens. Meaning that they are tokens of one type, but each not interchangeable, each with their own characteristics. For example, a collectable stamp is an example of NFT. All stamps are... stamps. But each stamp has its own characteristics, value and history.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's bandwidth? </summary>
Bandwidth is the amount of information someone can pass through some resource at a given time frame. For example (which is a mere analogy), if I can move 5 stones from room A to room B in the space of one hour. Then we can say that my stone bandwidth is 5 stones per hour. Bandwidth in IT relates to information and the ability to pass a certain amount of data from one place to another. <br> 
In cyber bandwidth plays a major role. It is a spam protection mechanism. It allows a user to only do a certain amount of transaction in a certain amount of time. Then, over time, it regenerates to give the user more ability to commit more transactions.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is Sybil resistance? </summary>
Sybil resistant means that it can withstand Sybil attacks. A Sybil attack is simply an attack on a system where the attacker uses a lot of pseudo (fake) identities to gain influence (usually, in terms of computational power) for himself.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is BFT? </summary>
FT is an abbreviation for Byzantine fault tolerance. It is a system that tackles the Byzantine general problem (a problem in which 4 generals need to come to an agreement of successfully attacking a city at the same time). In blockchains, each node (computer) needs to agree with one another on the current state of the network securely and efficiently. BFT is designed in such a way to help avoid the Byzantine generals problem. It is designed to achieve agreement even if some of the communicating nodes involved act maliciously. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary> What is POS? </summary>
Proof of Stake is the name of the consensus algorithm (way of agreeing) that is used in certain blockchain systems. Its main ideas is to protect the system through the use of the stake of its participants. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary> What is staking?</summary>
Staking is the process of "locking" your tokens to receive rewards.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is the purpose of staking?  </summary>
The purpose of staking is network security. The tokens that are locked, the better for the system. This is done to prevent the so-called 51% attack. Which means that someone gains access to 51% of the resources and can then cheat the system in his favour. The rewards are the incentive which users receive for "locking" their tokens to protect the system.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Who or what are validators? </summary>
The validators are someone or rather a computer. Well, the word validator refers to both. Someone who runs a specific computer and the computer itself. Validators are making sure that all the transactions (communications) carried out in cyber are done correctly (i.e. that users aren't trying to cheat the system). Validators are auditable computers and their work is transparent. They have to reach consensus on the state of the ledger. And in cyber they compute (calculate) the knowledge graph that the users commit links to (they also commit links to the graph). For their work, they receive a reward from the blockchain. Which is automatically calculated by the system. Validators also participate in governance and can stake tokens to receive rewards. They can also stake delegators tokens and pay rewards out. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What or who is a delegator? </summary>
Delegators are uses that delegate their tokens to validators to participate in receiving staking rewards. For this validators might charge commission. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are smart contracts? </summary>
Smart contracts are programs that can program your protocol to behave in a certain way. For example, tell it to pay 10 coins to user A after he accomplishes a certain task. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a VM? </summary>
A virtual machine in computing is a computer system that allows one system to behave like another. In other words, it is a system inside another type of system. A real-world analogy would be the film "aliens". The alien is a VM in this case. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are knowledge graphs? </summary>
Knowledge graphs are a compilation of facts and information that provide meaning to a specific search result. I.E. if you search for Bitcoin, you might see a box on the side of the search results with lots of data about Bitcoin, what it is, where to get some, etc. This is essentially, the work of a knowledge graph. Currently, knowledge graphs use data from Wikipedia, Wikidata and other sources (which almost all, belong to google). 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's PageRank? </summary>
It is one of the algorithms used by google to rank search results. At a very basic level, it is based on the principle of counting incoming, quality links. Based on this information it decides what website should be ranked higher.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is web3? </summary>
Web3 is the next evolutionary step in the development of the web. A step that takes away from centralisation of search and social services and away from things that are depended on a single functioning unit (have a central source of authority). It is a step that desires to see involved counterparties and applications communicate directly one with another. In agreement with each other, whilst also, be motivated for this behaviour. And as a result, achieve a safer routing of data and packets (information exchange) on the web.<br>
Often, you might notice the term `Great Web` in our documents. For us, The Great Web is a much better-suited name for the more common term `web3`.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is IPFS?  </summary>
IPFS is a peer-to-peer (directly connected between two users) protocol, that is designed to make the web faster, safer, and more open. IPFS makes it possible to spread across high volumes of data and keeps every version of your files. IPFS makes it simple to set up networks for mirroring data. This means that data is pretty much immutable or if you may - everlasting.<br> 
IPFS helps to further distribute the web amongst peers (users). It enables constant availability — with or without internet connectivity. You can share and view files, manage large chunks of data, build applications, etc. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's governance? </summary>
Governance is the process via which the users of the ecosystem decide on what's going to be funded, how it is going to happen, etc. They do so via a voting mechanism.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a DAO? </summary>
A DAO is a decentralised autonomous organisation. It is a unity of users that mutually decided on the governance of something. This can be a protocol, a fund, an organisation, etc. A DAO does not have a physical representation. It is represented with the help of cryptography and code. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's Aragon? </summary>
Aragon is an application for creating decentralized, autonomous organisations backed by code rather than by centralised law. The distributed code becomes the law, where participating users have a say and an incentive for participating in the application/protocol. One may create global, bureaucracy-free organizations, companies, and communities with the help of Aragon. 
</details>


<details>
  <summary>What are prediction markets? </summary>
Prediction markets are an example of communicating and financial incentives between actors (users) of an open market. A user can say "It is raining now" and back this information with data from a local weather station. Others may agree or disagree with this statement based on evidence provided by the initial predictor. He may put at stake his reputation or money. What this provides us with, is a system where rather than trusting a centralised source for providing certain information, we have a large number of independent sources, providing their opinion on a certain event with evidence. Hence, creating a provable and auditable service for some type of data (usually backed with a financial record). 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's an entity?  </summary>
An entity is an existing thing. An entity exists and that's all it needs to do to be an entity.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's a foundation? </summary>
When talking about construction a foundation is the lowest load-bearing part of a structure or building. When referring to organisations, a foundation is an entity that is managing the governing questions regarding its actions/structure, etc
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's a congress? </summary>
Congress can be a group of people picked by others to make challenging decisions. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a hardware wallet in terms of crypto?  </summary>
There are numerous ways to store your cryptocurrency (tokens). There are hot wallets. A hot wallet is one with access to the internet. There are two categories. One is when you own your private key (the good way) and in the other - is when you don't own your private key. For example, if you keep your tokens on an exchange (that's a bad way - do not do this!). You should always remember one simple rule: `Not your keys - not your crypto!`<br> 
There are cold wallets. Which are pretty safe if are created following a normal set of guidelines (plenty of guides around the internet). A cold wallet is one that does not have access to the internet. This can be a paper wallet or a physical wallet (either a metal device or a hardware wallet that never had access to the net).<br> 
Finally, there are hardware wallets (they can also be hot or cold). A hardware wallet is a small digital device which requires physical access to make a transaction. Usually, they come in the form of a slightly bigger than your typical USB stick which you can connect to your PC and you need to press buttons physically on the device to do anything.  Of course, this drastically increases security, even if the device is considered hot.

### Using cyber: The very basics

### The philopophy behind cyber
To understand cyber one first needs to understand its philosophy. Our work isn't simply technical. We base our work on our values. If it wasn't for them, we were not be building cyber. To be completely open about our intentions, I will jump into the story of the team behind cyber, and how values are our core driver. The core team knows each other for several years and has worked together previously. At one point, a few years ago we separated our ways, only to realize that whatever we do, we do not share values of others, hence, bringing the team back together.

What do we believe in? Firstly we believe in freedom, privacy and decentralization. We share and propagate the vision of improving this world. We believe that evil stands behind a centralized, bureaucratic approach to technology, governance, communication protocols (money), etc.

We do believe in code. We believe in innovation and in making use of our knowledge to make the world a slightly better place for our children. With that in mind, what we are trying to say, is that cyber and cyb are not just technological results. They are much more. At its base lay the values of the team behind cyber. We hope that our project can re-create certain values of what we believe the blockchain paradigm stands for. 

**Q:** What problem are you trying to solve? <br>
**A:** We are trying to solve the problem of data centralization and data censorship. Which in other words, is decentralization of common knowledge (assuming that data is the new knowledge and that we are moving into the digital age). 

**Q:** Why are you doing this? <br>
**A:** Each person should be able to control their own data, their identity, their knowledge. The universe can become a better place if our children live in a digital environment where they are in charge of their actions.

**Q:** What's wrong with google? <br>
**A:** google is a brilliant idea. We do not deny this. But google is the rebel that has overthrown the dictator and became the dictator itself. google uses you to shape the essence and the fundamentals of communications between everyone and everything. Whilst at it, google doesn't care for anyone and will make money on your action and your behalf.<br>
It should be noted, that by this question I am attempting not just at google, but at all the mega-digital corporations. Feel free to check out what this can lead to in the shape of [Cambridge Analityca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica). If this case is too much to take in or too "loud" for you, feel free to watch some episodes of Black Mirror to see how digital control can "break" society.

**Q:** Why now? <br>
**A:** Because we are almost done with post-industrialism. We are slowly and surely moving into the digital realm. One can deny or accept this. Now is the time to either have the tools that will help us to shape the matrix the way we want to shape it or give those powers away to someone to control all aspects of our lives.

**Q:** Why search? <br>
**A:** Search is a global mechanism that is globally understood by everyone, regardless of language, race, age, etc. It is somewhat a basic instinct (searching for food to survive, etc). In the digital realm with the help of search, we gain answers to our questions, which we always ask. Search helps us to build a model around any subject that is of interest to us. With the use of search, we can build databases, which can lead to a great number of useful instruments (on these later).

**Q:** Aren't there other, more important problems to solve? <br>
**A:** There probably are. But we decided to focus on this because we understand how to achieve the required result. There are probably more problems and questions to be solved (like hunger, wars, ecology, etc). Our tool can help to play a role in solving if not all, but some of these.

**Q:** Aren't there other things out there that solve this? <br>
**A:** There is a lot of awesome, open-source technology on the market that can commit to making a change in the world. Most of the technology we use is not something we invented (although the code itself is written from scratch!). They are technologies that have existed previously and are awesome at doing what they do. Our software is a combination of existing technologies, protocols and our own work that has arisen from this. It is specifically targeted at fixing what is broken.

**Q:** How can users/developers/others benefit from using such a system in comparison to google, etc? <br>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/7hX2GbQC/cyber.png" />

**Q:** Why do you need consensus within Cyber? <br>
**A:** A consensus is required for nodes to agree on the current state of the ledger at any given point of time. This is needed to achieve security, transparency, immutability and decentralization. 

**Q:** What is your take on: privacy/censorship/routing? <br>
**A:** We believe that privacy should be a fundamental right. As of now, the protocol is pseudo-private (just like Bitcoin is). I.E. you know which hash linked something and with what weight, but you don't know the real name of the user. With that, we are planning to implement full privacy into the protocol.<br>
We are strongly discouraged by any censorship and view it as a sin against any living and/or thinking organism.<br> 
Routing should be always permitted. Transactions should always be permitted to pass. Otherwise, this is censorship. 

**Q:** Do you not think that the motto #fuckgoogle is offensive? <br>
**A:** Fuck no! Fucking is not for pain, it's for pleasure!

**Congratulations!** You are now a cyber~Cosmonaut and a have all the tools that you need to build the `Great Web`! We salute you for completing this journey. Help us to improve by learning how to submit a PR and find more links that will help you to survive out in the wild.

### Improving this document
We welcome and eagerly await new builders to help us prepare our spaceships for take-off. Its never been as easy, just do it - [sumbit a pull request with an improvement!](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/pulls)
A pull request is essentially a way to contribute to any open-source project on GitHub. Whilst we are not planning to teach you how to use GitHub, we strongly advise you to learn how to use both git and GitHub. It is fairly easy and simple and will be a great tool for you to add to your skills. Check out [this free guide](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners). Please note, that to submit a PR, you don't need to read over it, it's even simpler than you might think. 

1) Open your favourite, web2, browser, navigate to [github.com](https://github.com/), fill in the info and hit the `Sign up` button in the top right corner:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/hjn1Wssc/Screenshot-from-2020-02-06-14-28-41.png" />

2) After you verify your email, fill in user details, look around to get more acquainted, its time to find [our GitHub page](https://github.com/cybercongress). Either follow the link above or navigate to the page manually, using the search:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/CK7s0DQ8/Screenshot-from-2020-02-06-14-30-03.png" />

On the page find the [congress repositry](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress) (*hint*: it might not be located where you see it on the picture above): 

3) From there navigate to the `ecosystem` folder and find the [cyber Homestead doc](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md).

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wjT5MjRJ/Screenshot-from-2020-02-06-14-30-47.png" />

4) Click on the pencil icon next to the `History` button! This will take you to the edit page. Here you may edit the document with what you think needs to be added (this might be another guide, a new picture, diagram, etc). Do not be scared of messing it up, the changes will NOT be automatically added to the doc on our GitHub. Let's change the title:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/TPvRQpj5/Screenshot-from-2020-02-06-14-32-14.png" />

5) Hit `Preview changes` to see how it looks (you may scroll down, of course, if needed) (*hint*: any new or removed change will have a colour to the left of it): 

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/CKbb6BW3/Screenshot-from-2020-02-06-14-32-26.png" />

6) After you made sure that you added what you wanted and it looks like you want it to look, scroll to the bottom of the page and find the `Commit changes` box. Add a description of your changes, make sure you are on a new branch and hit the green `Propose file change`

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/7PKtNd1g/Screenshot-from-2020-02-06-14-33-16.png" />

And this is it. It is submitted and awaits our review. You may and should [open an issue](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues) to speed up and accompany the process.
