## Deep Bidirectional Transformers (working name)

<p> I am going to try to create our first public request for research and an implementation based on that research. This is an experiment to see how we can use such a workflow to evolve. </p> 
<p> This file is meant to serve as a basis for a discussion that should, in theory, follow this request. Please feel free to correct its format / styling, etc. </p>

### Rationale
We believe that all species/beings can control their private keys, hence then can communicate, hence they can make transactions.
Hence their will can be represented on a knowledge graph (and queried).

### Some background discussion (user story)?
<p>
Following the discussion that was started by a community member with regards to our documentation and whether what we discuss can have an implementation, 
we have decided to try and create an incentivized grant that will be awarded to those/that who manage to accomplish the necessary steps for it, described below.
</p>
<p>
The question started the discussion is how can an entity be seen as intelligent (meaning that they can control their private keys and
sign transactions) if cyber refers to all thinking formations as intelligent (including the likes of plants, animals, robots, etc).
</p>
<p>
Our presumption is based on the simple idea that intelligence is not as complicated as previously thought of about. There are plenty of
proofs that any species can communicate via the means of electromagnetic impulses (signals). Therefore, intelligence can be described as a form of "communication".
Where storing private keys, constructing a transaction and signing it is communicating, hence making a decision. Hence - "thinking". Hence - intelligence.
Experiments such as the rail-road fungi experiments in Tokyo and London have already proven that plants and similar subspecies in question (let alone other beings)
are more than capable of making well thought out decisions.
</p>
<p>
Cyber is creating a meaningful (and a distributed) relevance machine. A network of machines that can create a provable model of the universe based on the will of the agents that are generating information for the required/desired knowledge graph/s. From this
information, beings can build models / make decisions / ask questions / receive answers. Search is, in fact, the essence of thinking
(more on this in our paper and posts).
</p>

### The task
The task can be broken into two parts (1) the research and (2) the implementation. <br><br>
<b>1)</b> The research should contain some (or all) of the answers to some of the following statements/questions: <br>
<i>(the research must contain solid proofs and references to previous scientific work)</i> 
- Describe the current use case and the modern outlook of semantic core created by Google
- Propose distributed alternatives and their advantages
- Analyze the depths that semantics are touching on (quantum/physical/others)
- Discuss the creation and the possible implementations of the new metaverse
- Analize the behaviour of possible agents in the new metaverse
- Describe how the new agents can complement to the already existing semantics
- Discuss the possible creation of (completely) new types of agents
- Describe how can semantic tunnelling aka Inter Knowledge Protocol can be implemented into the protocol 
- Discuss whether or not future implementations can be based on neurological implementations
- Analisis of  ML algorithms that can help to implement the above described
- Discuss the future outlook of knowledge graphs implemented by new types of agents / their semantics

<b>2)</b> The implementation can have other alternatives, but this is how we see it at the current stage:<br>
<i>(the implementation must be in the form of functioning code)</i>
- We presume that work must be concentrated around one knowledge graph
- The model described by the research should be implemented into the current knowledge graph (although, we are open for the 
the possibility that new graphs must be built to achieve this implementation - please provide proofs for this)
- Semantic tunnels can be achieved via the use of IKP
- Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding should probably be used
- Lie algebras should probably be used to describe physical systems

### Definition of Done
My presumption that a definition of "done" in this case would contain 2 steps:
1) A research document, backed by evidence such as mathematical proofs, some illustration and references to other research
2) A pull request that offers an implementation of the above research into the cyber protocol

### Additional Information
I believe that the following links might come useful:
- [cyber~Congress: The evolution of species](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/README.md)
- [cyber~Congress: The evolution of species: the Philosophy](https://ai.cybercongress.ai/t/cyber-congress-the-evolution-of-species-the-philosophy/20)
- [Certain discussions on our TG channel](https://t.me/fuckgoogle/5081)
- [Protocol paper](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber/blob/master/main.tex)

### Bonus implementation 
I would like to propose a bonus that would be possible only upon completion of the above task.
I strongly believe that physical experiments can go a long way. Hence, I would propose to offer a bonus on top of the grant (whatever it maybe)
for anyone who completes the task, but also carries out the following work:
- Experiments with living creatures (no species should be harmed during those experiments and proofs for this must be presented separately!)
- I see such an experiment on fungi and ants, as those are very easy to cultivate and let free after (only a proposition)
- Such an experiment should show the possibility of the species in hand to be able to prove to be intelligent (i.e. digitally transact)
- I believe that as crazy as this sounds, an implementation doesn't have to look somewhat sci-fi, but could be summarized as (for example): a fungus creating a transaction to receive a reward 
- This part is not necessary for obtaining the grant. But merely an idea
