- What our unique insight is
- How much progress we have made
- What is impressive about our team
- Summary of the most powerful facts

#### We are cybercongress
The blockchain technology has opened the opportunity for development, which was impossible before. We are sovereign self-funded company of developers, engineers, scientists and craftmens who create the basis for a new type of existence. With this we introduce and experiment with a fundamentally new approach to self-management and the development of a community oriented towards our set of values and goals.

#### Our values
We believe that our principles should be aligned with our values, thus helping us to achieve our goals:

- Security. We do not work with fiat or with bureaucratic paper hassle. We work only with digital signatures
- Anonymity and privacy. If someone chooses to stay anonymous or private, it is their right to do so
- Open-source software. Everything we run in production must be open-source
- Open-source hardware. Every piece of hardware that goes into production, must be open-sourced
- Transparency. Transactional transparency is fundamental to community building
- Informational freedom. No local laws can prohibit the flow of any information
- Economic freedom. Nobody has the right to prevent or block transactions
- Free will. We reject corporate slavery bullshit, such as conflict of interest or NDA
- Engineering is marketing. We would rather spend our resources on engineering then marketing
- Physical liberty. Limitations for physical liberty can be economic, but not authoritative
- Automation. Everything that can be automated, must be automated transactions
- Decentralization. Everything that can be decentralized, shall be decentralized
- Always on the edge. We try to offer alternatives to outdated technologies such as emails

### Our goals.
Make focus on transactions [e.g cyber-search/cyberd]

We intend to build a strong scientific foundation with self-sustainable community that adhere to our purposes:

  - Provide an abundant access to information proved by transactions for all species
  - Build an incentivization system for open-source communities and creators
  - Make consensus computers more usable, scalable, performant and cheap
  - Develop hardware interfaces and software protocols for ubiquitous, private and uncensored communications across universes
  - Integrate post-quantum cryptography
  - Develop open-source technologies for self-sustainable living
  - Find an open approach for creating self-aware, self-replicating and economically independent robots
  - Create mainstream tools for biological engineering and body augmentations
  - Integrate cybernomics into humans, robots, animals, plants and other thinking formation
  - Demolish all state borders across the universe
  - Find an open approach for creating incentivized and decentralized AI
  - Switch governmentally inclined business models from violent taxing to non-violent
  - Create technologies for accessible space exploration and transportation
  - Create technologies for the transfer of human consciousness to an electronic and digital environment
  - Significantly extend living capabilities for all species up to - but not limited, to 10k years;
  - Create the foundation for thermoregulation and for terraforming the Earth and other nearby planets
  - Build the foundation for the emergence of unified spacetime ownership registry
  - Participate in the development of Metaverse

#### Our history
Our history is just begun but talking about our history we must make special mention of the cyber•Fund. In April 2018 @xhipster, @litvintech and @hleb-albau established a new company. As result we created an [agreement](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/agreement.md) and explained who we are, for what we are and our values and goals. This is very powerful and important thing what we made as init of our work. @xhipster have very exciting and beautiful past with cyber•Fund and we tried to bear in mind the mistakes of cyber•Fund initiation. Development of new Agreement was start with incredible analysis of @xhipster experience. Cyber•Fund was created at November 2013. In November 2015 we developed cyber•Fund: Genesis Agreement. It was one of the first formal charter signed by participants on Blockchain with proof of existence and hash of this doc. As you see we totally formalized our mission only after two years. In fact two years @xhipster didn't know what to do! Second very important point is that they didn't define goals in an Agreement. That's why they moving toward sometimes. But really big problem what @xhipster see now in a retrospective is that we didn't define values. This had impeded the development of cyber•Fund. That has led to fork cyber•Congress from cyber•Fund and cyber•Academy from cyber•Events. Now we defined our values in an cyber•Congress Agreement and we hope that Congress will no repeating failures of the cyber•Fund past. We're very young but we have huge experience. Our goals and values isn't just a general words. For us they are direct orders how to grow up. We clearly define what we need to do and what we absolutely don't need to do. Also we decided to abandon fiat money as it possible and third-party money to. We held a investment round inside the team and to farm 582 ETH. It's enough to deliver MVP coming year. If we're wrong we'll attract one more round. Attracting money from the team is a significant motivation for the team to do something and we are glad to tell that all teammates support this initiative.

So what exactly is Congress? Congress is a for profit/non profit entity. We think this Hybrid is first in industry ever. It is not a fund therefore congress have no and will have no obligations. It's self funded entity. Drop processing model is:
  - 60% to delf through pumping tokens under management
  - 20% to Congress members
  - 20% to teams

It's a first incentive model. The second one is working then Congress member want to leave Congress or Congress decide to liquidate itself. In those cases:
  - 50% to members
  - 25% to teams
  - 25% to community
  Namely 50% of member funds will stay at the Congress and dropping with first model.

#### Our team
Here is changeTheWorld oriented team:

@xhipster - architector and visioner. Also cybernomic guru.

@litvintech - creator and experimenter. Also blockchain husband.

@hleb-albau - developer and engineer, also guy who know how it does.

@asadovka - PM and solver. Also guy who count money.

@pechalka - JS, frontend and fullstack developer. Also guy who look at blockchain with passion and sadness.

@vstavetski - Kotlin and backend developer. Also guy who like Honda tuning.

@savetheales - community manager. Also guy who like tasks on gitcoin.

@olga584 - tech and graph designer. Also girl.

@arturalbov - Kotlin and Go backend developer. Also young guy with big ambitions.

Also only fitting to tell about operation processes in our team. As you see we have no CEO. We think that is bullshit to delegate all management tools to one person. We have 2 of 3 multisig. It's a agile and simple way to negotiate.

#### Current project
Here is full stack of our projects:
- [cyb](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb) - web3 browser
- [cybernode](https://github.com/cybercongress/cybernode) - client for p2p network
- [cyberd](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberd) - protocol for p2p network
- [cyber-search](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber-search) - toolchain for transactions parsing and processing
- [cybjs](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb-js) - generic module for web3 developers
- [cyber-markets](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber-markets) - toolchain for trades/orders parsing and processing
- [chaingear](https://github.com/cybercongress/chaingear) - the Metaregistry for your registry

Our development process is structured on two-weeks sprints and 4-5 months blocks. In August 2018 our first block has finished. We have faced with out-of-focus problem and lack of resources as a result. So we have develop new [roadmap](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/Reports/second-block.md) on the next block with understandable metrics and milestones. So for the next five months we will focus on [cyberd](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberd) and [cyb](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb). Also on a [cybernode](https://github.com/cybercongress/cybernode) in those new role.

In addition we intend to integrate [chaingear](https://github.com/cybercongress/chaingear) in [cyb](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb) as dapp. Another projects have not been forgotten. They will developing through the community on the [gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/). So you're welcome.

#### Contacts
According our values we decide use next communication channels:

- [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybercongress)
- [steemit](https://steemit.com/@cybercongress)
- [twitter](https://twitter.com/cyber_devs)
- [Telegram dev chat](https://t.me/fuckgoogle)
- [Telegram announce channel](https://t.me/cybercongress)

And [github](https://github.com/cybercongress) of course!

#### Summarize
Cyber•Congress is not about the software. Is not about hardware, development, blockchain or whatever. Is not about cybernomics and progress. It about principal new existence model.

We intend to aim for this with passion and patience till our goals is not be taken. And so on. Probably.

#### What you can find in our blog?

In our blog you will find actual information about projects states. Also you can enjoy our regular column "Top 10 gitcoin tasks". Reports about our work and tutorials. All of this content will be created by our teammates therefore it will life, honest and useful.
We will share not just dev things but organization processes and structure too. Will discuss problems and so on.
Enjoy!
