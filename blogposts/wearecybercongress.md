Goal of this post make description of cybercongress, our values and goals.


Points to cover:
- What your company does
- How your company does it
- What your unique insight is
- How much progress you have made
- What is impressive about your team
- Summary of the most powerful facts

#### We are cybercongress
The blockchain technology has opened the opportunity for development, which was impossible before. We are sovereign self-funded company of developers, engineers, scientists and craftmens who create the basis for a new type of existence. With this we introduce and experiment with a fundamentally new approach to self-management and the development of a community oriented towards our set of values and goals.

#### Our values
We believe that our principles should be aligned with our values, thus helping us to achieve our goals:

- Security. We do not work with fiat or with bureaucratic paper hassle. We work only with digital signatures
- Anonymity and privacy. If someone chooses to stay anonymous or private, it is their right to do so
- Open-source software. Everything we run in production must be open-source
- Open-source hardware. Every piece of hardware that goes into production, must be open-sourced
- Transparency. Transactional transparency is fundamental to community building
- Informational freedom. No local laws can prohibit the flow of any information
- Economic freedom. Nobody has the right to prevent or block transactions
- Free will. We reject corporate slavery bullshit, such as conflict of interest or NDA
- Engineering is marketing. We would rather spend our resources on engineering then marketing
- Physical liberty. Limitations for physical liberty can be economic, but not authoritative
- Automation. Everything that can be automated, must be automated transactions
- Decentralization. Everything that can be decentralized, shall be decentralized
- Always on the edge. We try to offer alternatives to outdated technologies such as emails

### Our goals.
Make focus on transactions (e.g cyber-search/cyberd)

We intend to build a strong scientific foundation with self-sustainable community that adhere to our purposes:

  - Provide an abundant access to information proved by transactions for all species
  - Build an incentivization system for open-source communities and creators
  - Make consensus computers more usable, scalable, performant and cheap
  - Develop hardware interfaces and software protocols for ubiquitous, private and uncensored communications across universes
  - Integrate post-quantum cryptography
  - Develop open-source technologies for self-sustainable living
  - Find an open approach for creating self-aware, self-replicating and economically independent robots
  - Create mainstream tools for biological engineering and body augmentations
  - Integrate cybernomics into humans, robots, animals, plants and other thinking formation
  - Demolish all state borders across the universe
  - Find an open approach for creating incentivized and decentralized AI
  - Switch governmentally inclined business models from violent taxing to non-violent
  - Create technologies for accessible space exploration and transportation
  - Create technologies for the transfer of human consciousness to an electronic and digital environment
  - Significantly extend living capabilities for all species up to - but not limited, to 10k years;
  - Create the foundation for thermoregulation and for terraforming the Earth and other nearby planets
  - Build the foundation for the emergence of unified spacetime ownership registry
  - Participate in the development of Metaverse

#### Summarize
Cyberâ€¢Congress is not about the software. Is not about hardware, development, blockchain or whatever. Is not about cybernomics and progress. It about principal new existence model.

We intend to aim for this with passion and patience till our goals is not be taken.
