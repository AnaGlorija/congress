# Communication

There is only one communication channel of cyber~Congress: Cyberlinked blog in Bostrom network. Other communication channels must not be trusted. The process is straightforward:

1. Preparation happens in Github. Anybody can [submit post](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/pulls).
2. The post must be reviewed by both @mastercyb and @litvintech. 
3. Other reviews can be summoned.
4. After the merge of a post it must be signed and cyberlinked by multisig.
5. Cyberlinked posts can be spread to other communication channels led by community.
